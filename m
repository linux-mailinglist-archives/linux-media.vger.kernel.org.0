I wonder what's your opinion about the buffered one then :-D

Ack.

Unless we come up with a completely new type of M2M that can behave like a =
gap
filler (like a video rate m2m), it indeed makes no sense for output. I'm ju=
st
illustrating that this is true "now" but someone can come up with valid
expectation. So I agree with you, we can move it up in the hierarchy.

Recently over IRC and other threads, Tomasz raised a concern that CODECs wh=
ere
introducing too much complexity into M2M. And I believe buffered (which is
barely documented) and this mechanism was being pointed.

My take on that is that adding boolean configuration is what introduce
complexity, and we can fix it by doing less in the m2m. After this discussi=
on, I
came with the idea that we should remove buffered and ignore_streaming. For
drivers that don't implement job_ready, this logic would be moved inside th=
e
default implementation. We can then add a helper to check the common condit=
ions.

The alternative suggested by Tomasz, was to layer two ops. We'd have a
device_ready() ops and its default implementation would include the check w=
e
have and would call job_ready(). Personally, I'd rather remove then add, bu=
t I
understadt the reasoning and would be fine committing to that instead.

I'd like your feedback on this proposal. If this is something we want, I'll=
 do
this prior to V13, otherwise we will address your comments and fix the adde=
d
mechanism. I think though that we agree that for decoders, this is nice add=
ition
to not have to trigger work manually from vb2 ops.

regards,
Nicolas
