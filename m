Is grid image encoding part of the spec for this format? Is this something
that the venus hardware needs due to image resolution limitations as
described above?

Would it be possible for the driver to handle this internally? I.e.,
if it detects that it needs to switch to grid mode, can it just encode
each grid and copy it in the capture buffer? This assumes that there is
metadata that can be used by a decoder do find and decode each grid.

Can the driver make a choice of the grid size, and the control just
reports the grid size? I.e., does it make sense for userspace to set
this?

The wiki page [1] doesn't mention grids, so where does this come from?
Is it part of some spec? Or is it a venus-specific feature?

I notice that this RFC just talks about the encoder, does venus also
support a decoder? How would a HW decoder handle grids?
