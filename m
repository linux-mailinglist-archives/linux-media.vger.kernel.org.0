The error code may be misleading. ENOSPC is used here to report that the
maximum CCDC bandwidth has been exceeded, not that the driver is running
out of memory.

The check is performed in isp_video_check_external_subdevs(), and the
maximum CCDC bandwidth is calculated by omap3isp_ccdc_max_rate():

	/*
	 * TRM says that for parallel sensors the maximum data rate
	 * should be 90% form L3/2 clock, otherwise just L3/2.
	 */
	if (ccdc->input == CCDC_INPUT_PARALLEL)
		rate = pipe->l3_ick / 2 * 9 / 10;
	else
		rate = pipe->l3_ick / 2;

Could you point me to the part of the OMAP3 datasheet that you think
allows for 96 MHz ?
