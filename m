I do not care for the page_pool_iov name either; I presumed it was least
change to prove an idea and the name and details would evolve.

How about something like buffer_pool or netdev_buf_pool that can operate
with either pages, dma addresses, or something else in the future?

Use of the LSB (or bits depending on alignment expectations) is a common
trick and already done in quite a few places in the networking stack.
This trick is essential to any realistic change here to incorporate gpu
memory; way too much code will have unnecessary churn without it.

I do prefer my earlier suggestion though where the skb_frag_t has a
union of relevant types though. Instead of `struct page *page` it could
be `void *addr` with the helpers indicating page, iov, or other.
