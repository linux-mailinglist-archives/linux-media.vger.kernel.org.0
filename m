Hi All,

Here is version 5 of my series to adjust the INT3472 code's handling of
the privacy LED on x86 laptops with MIPI camera(s) so that it will also
work on devices which have a privacy-LED GPIO but not a clk-enable GPIO
(so that we cannot just tie the LED state to the clk-enable state).

Changes in v5:
- Rename lookup-table names to match those from the gpio and reset lookups:
  s/led_name/provider/
  s/consumer_dev_name/dev_id/
  s/consumer_function/con_id/
- Add static inline wrappers for the v4l2_async debugfs init/exit funcs,
  to fix build errors when CONFIG_V4L2_ASYNC is not enabled

Changes in v4:
- Rename new __led_get() helper to led_module_get()
- Drop of/devicetree support from "led-class: Add generic [devm_]led_get()"
- Add RFC patch to re-add of/devicetree support to show that the new
  led_get() can easily be extended with dt support when the need for this
  arises (proof-of-concept dt code, not intended for merging)
- New patch to built async and fwnode code into videodev.ko,
  to avoid issues with some of the new LED code getting builtin vs
  other parts possibly being in a module
- Move the led_get() call to v4l2_async_register_subdev_sensor()
- Move the led_disable_sysfs() call to be done at led_get() time
- Address some other minor review comments

Changes in v3:
- Due to popular request by multiple people this new version now models
  the privacy LED as a LED class device. This requires being able to
  "tie" the LED class device to a specific camera sensor (some devices
  have multiple sensors + privacy-LEDs).

Patches 1-5 are LED subsystem patches for this. 1 is a bug fix, 2-4 add
the new [devm_]led_get() functions. Patch 5 is the RFC patch adding dt
support to led_get() and is not intended for merging.

Patch 6 + 7 add generic privacy-LED support to the v4l2-core/v4l2-subdev.c
code automatically enabling the privacy-LED when s_stream(subdev, 1)
is called. So that we don't need to add privacy-LED code to all the
camera sensor drivers separately (as requested by Sakari).

Patches 8-11 are patches to the platform specific INT3472 code to register
privacy-LED class devices + lookup table entries for privacy-LEDs described
in the special INT3472 ACPI nodes found on x86 devices with MIPI cameras.

Assuming at least the LED maintainers are happy with the approach suggested
here, the first step to merging this would be to merge patches 1-4 and then
provide an immutable branch with those to merge for the other subsystems
since the other changes depend on these.

If you are one of the folks who requested the new LED lookup table +
led_get() approach I would appreciate a Reviewed-by or Acked-by for
patches 1-4.

This series has been tested on:

- Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga gen 7, IPU6, front: ov2740 with privacy LED
- Dell Latitude 9420, IPU 6, front: ov01a1s with privacy LED
- Mirosoft Surface Go, IPU3, front: ov5693 with privacy LED
                              back: ov8865 with privacy LED (pled not yet supported)

Regards,

Hans
