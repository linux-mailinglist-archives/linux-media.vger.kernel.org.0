Well amdgpu already has dma_fence waits in the hmm callbacks, so
nothing new. But since you start using these in amdkfd ... perfect
opportunity to annotate the amdkfd paths for fence signalling critical
sections? Especially the preempt-ctx fence should be an interesting
case to annotate and see whether lockdep finds anything. Not sure what
else there is.
