Ok, I will add the check, test it with my current driver (see below) 
that triggers it and send a patch.

I came across this when fiddling with our mgb4 driver. We have updated 
the FW to support YUV in addition to RGB and added independent timers 
for frame dropping (the current driver is "wrong" as it provides 
VIDIOC_G_PARM/VIDIOC_S_PARM with V4L2_CAP_TIMEPERFRAME but can not in 
fact set it with the original FW). The inputs in mgb4 have 
ENUM_FRAMESIZES and a request from a card user to add the callback to 
the outputs to be "symmetrical" with the inputs.

 From what you wrote above I get the message that the "proper" way how 
to extend the output callbacks is rather to add ENUM_DV_TIMINGS (which 
is also missing, the driver implements it only for the inputs at the 
moment), but the question "what to do with ENUM_FRAMESIZES?" stays. I 
would like to either have it implemented for both the inputs/outputs or 
for none of them. And adding the callback to the output looks to me as a 
better solution than to remove it from the input as some people already 
use it. But to call this a bug and remove it is also ok for me (the 
driver will at least work with the current, unpatched, version of qv4l2).
