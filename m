I have aASUS Transformer Book T101HA-GR029T (HW probe @

Cool!

Meanwhile I downloaded to kernel source and checked out the latest 
commit that still has the driver in staging. I'm currently in the 
process of building the old kernel in order to test if the driver works 
at all (1st time I'm doing this - thus takes some time, especially on my 
Atom :-). But I will then switch over to your changed version to give it 
a try.
