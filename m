Hi Rafael,

Thank you for the review.

My understanding still remains that this patch does not (or other patches
in this set) change the above. It is just how those nodes are reached:
instead of traversing the entire tree and ignoring the devices that have
already an acpi_device created for them, a linked list of devices of
interest is traversed.

Of course it is possible that I have missed something. The codebase isn't
entirely trivial.
