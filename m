I tested it, but it still fails, and the error message is even more cryptic=
:

=09Sphinx error:
=09Builder name pdf not registered or available through entry point
=09make[1]: *** [Documentation/Makefile:120: rst2pdf] Error 2
=09make: *** [Makefile:1663: rst2pdf] Error 2

It seems to me that the missing dependency should be treated in the Makefil=
e
target rather than in Sphinx. Looking through the Makefile, I took inspirat=
ion
from the latex version and did the following:

=09HAVE_RST2PDF :=3D $(shell if python -c "import rst2pdf" >/dev/null 2>&1;=
 then echo 1; else echo 0; fi)

=09=20
=09ifeq ($(HAVE_RST2PDF),0)

=09rst2pdf:
=09       $(warning The 'rst2pdf' python module was not found. Make sure yo=
u have it installed to produce PDF output.)
=09       @echo "  SKIP    Sphinx $@ target."

=09else # HAVE_RST2PDF

=09rst2pdf:
=09       @$(srctree)/scripts/sphinx-pre-install --version-check
=09       @+$(foreach var,$(SPHINXDIRS),$(call loop_cmd,sphinx,pdf,$(var),p=
df,$(var)))

=09endif # HAVE_RST2PDF

With this, the following message is shown in case it isn't installed:

=09Documentation/Makefile:122: The 'rst2pdf' python module was not found. M=
ake sure you have it installed to produce PDF output.
=09  SKIP    Sphinx rst2pdf target.

But with that check on the Makefile in place, on the Sphinx side, we can in=
deed
just do Jon's snippet to only add the extension if it is installed. Another
option would be to split the 'try' into 'try' and 'else', where the 'else' =
only
executes if the 'try' is succesful. The benefit is that this makes it clear=
er
that only the import is being "tried":

=09# Enable experimental rst2pdf, if available
=09try:
=09    import rst2pdf
=09except ModuleNotFoundError:
=09    pass
=09else:
=09    extensions.append("rst2pdf.pdfbuilder")

Something interesting I noticed is that when building with Sphinx 3, and if
rst2pdf is installed, even when building other targets, like htmldocs, (sin=
ce
the rst2pdf extension is added based on rst2pdf being installed and not if =
it is
being used) the following is printed:

=09WARNING: the rst2pdf.pdfbuilder extension is not safe for parallel writi=
ng
=09WARNING: doing serial write

Looking into rst2pdf's pdfbuilder.py, indeed 'parallel_write_safe' is False=
, so
we should probably make sure rst2pdf isn't negatively impacting build time =
for
other formats before merging this patch.

Thanks,
