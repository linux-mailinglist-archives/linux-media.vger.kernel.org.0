Ah, I found that discussion for the v2 of this series.

Yes, add that on top and we can discuss whether to Ack that -EINVAL patch or
not.

I don't see why we would want to continue supporting a broken model that is
also a security risk, as I understand it.

Tomasz, can you look at the discussion for this old RFC patch of mine:

https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/patch/20200221084531.576156-9-hverkuil-cisco@xs4all.nl/

Specifically, if we just drop support for follow_pfn(), would that cause
problems for Chromium since that is apparently still using USERPTR for encoders?
