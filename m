Should an overlay add these items to a simple-bus specific to that
overlay/device that is being supported?

That would 'namespace' the added fixed-clocks/fixed-regulators etc...

But maybe it's overengineering or mis-using the simple-bus.

And the items are still not on a 'bus' with an address - they just exist
on a presumably externally provided board....
