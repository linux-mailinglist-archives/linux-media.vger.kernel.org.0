Yes for both. I didn't share those as they're not in a presentable state =).

But, with the disclaimer that your eyes may bleed when reading the code:

git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tomba/linux.git 
multistream/work

git://github.com/tomba/kmsxx.git multistream

On the kernel side, the CAL driver is in relatively good shape. UB960 
driver is somewhat messy but not totally horrible. OV10635 is horrible, 
as it's used to fake metadata stream even if the sensor doesn't really 
have such a thing.

For testing I have used kms++ with python bindings. My test script is 
py/tests/cam.py

The uAPI has changed as there's now the 'which' field. But I think 
that's the only clear change, although the behavior could be slightly 
different wrt. setting formats.

  Tomi
