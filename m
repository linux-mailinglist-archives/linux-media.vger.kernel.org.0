Sure but my point is rather that rate control has to have some knowledge of=
 what
the GOP size is and what frame type comes next. Not to say that it has to m=
ake
that decision, but I believe it has to be aware of it.

That is good to know, especially since I do not have valuable knowledge abo=
ut
high-end rate control.

Yes I will certainly take a look in those directions when starting the work=
 on
rate control.

I think it would be necessary for the kernel to have the GOP size hint to do
rate-control, but user-side could still decide on frame types that do not m=
atch
the hint and mess with rate-control. Otherwise, it's not very different from
having the kernel decide on the frame type itself.

I guess I'm still not super convinced that it makes sense to have both
user-selectable frame type/references and kernel-side rate control.

Maybe one option would be to have two operating modes:
- "manual" mode, where user-side decides on the frame type, references and
  per-frame QP, without kernel-side rate control; This would be a purely
  stateless approach;
- "automatic" mode, where user-side decides on the GOP size, rate-control
  approach and kernel-side implements rate control to decide on the frame t=
ype,
  references and QP; This would be purely stateful.

The more I think about it, the more it feels like mixing the two into a uni=
fied
single approach would be messy and unclear. But maybe I'm wrong.

I kind of assumed it would be up to the kernel to do that translation, but =
maybe
it also makes sense to submit the commands directly from userspace?

It's not very clear to me what's best here.

Absolutely, it seems a bit difficult to care for cases we cannot really test
yet. Unfortunately I'm not aware of such hardware being around either.
