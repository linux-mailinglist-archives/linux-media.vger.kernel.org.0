Already talked to Mediatek about this and they are working on updating
the dma-buf patches for this.

It would be possible to use this with clearkey w/ some additional work
on our end. If this is then part of the public ChromiumOS build, would
that be satisfactory? (the TEE would have some binary blob components
like firmware does though)
