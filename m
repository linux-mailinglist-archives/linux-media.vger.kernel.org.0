Thank you for taking a look at this patch. Now I recalled that wanted to
run V4L2 compliance test, but forgot to do that.

I'll take a look at fluster, it's new to me.

V4L decoding works on par with the legacy custom UAPI used by this
driver. I wish the hardware spec was made public, so we could support
more complex streams, but since it's not going to happen, I think
nothing keeps this driver in staging. It's working good for what is
supported.

Initially I patched GStreamer to perform the flagging and it worked
okay. GStreamer even has variable for that, which is unused by the code
[1]. But in the end I decided that a universal solution will be a better
option.

Amending the spec will be great, although it's not clear how to flag
frame that consists of slices having different types.

Okay
