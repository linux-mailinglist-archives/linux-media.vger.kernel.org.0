I originally had it here, but then I moved to dev-subdev as an image
sensor will always be represented as a video sub-device, doen't it ?

That's a lot of work indeed. But it could be split as

1) Augment the 1.25.1 section with a mention of subdev, maybe using
   pieces of 4.13.3.2
2) Move what's in section 8 to be 1.25.x
   Actually merging 1.25.2 and 8.1.1, splitting 1.25.2 in a device and
   sub-device section

Two tables seems about right

I know 'image sensor' is not an API concept like device and subdevice,
but if we split 1.25.2 in 'video device' and 'subdevice' parts, a
section for 'image sensors' with what I've now put in section 4.13.3.3
(the description of the sensor array areas) could fit there ?

Seems like a long re-work. Can the imx219 patch be broke out and
fast-tracked ?

Thanks
