Just a bit of background.

A macro is required /at some point/ because arrays "decay" into pointers
when used as function arguments.

Come to think of it, I'm really not a fan of "large" macro functions.
I'll outline a different option in v2.


> Why cmd rather than __cmd? This seems inconsistent.

Note: I hate using underscores in macro argument names, but they clashed
with the struct field names. There was no such clash for 'cmd'.

Do you think it is important to avoid a local variable?

You're right. I found a better place.
