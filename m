I also see sg_alloc_table_from_pages being called in vb2_dc_get_userptr in videobuf2-dma-contig.c,
presumably that needs the same fix?

From what I gather from this thread there are no improved helpers on the immediate
horizon, so this issue has to be fixed in videobuf2 for now.

So this requires a v2 that fixes this also in vb2_dma_sg_get_userptr and vb2_dc_get_userptr,
correct? If so, then it would be nice if Anle can post a v2 with those changes.

Note that when I grepped for sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment users, I noticed that
in most cases dma_max_mapping_size is used, but in one case it uses dma_get_max_seg_size
(drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_ttm_buffer.c). I have no idea what the difference is
between the two.

One small change that would make sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment() a bit easier
to work with is if it would replace a max_segment value of 0 with UINT_MAX. Then
you can just stick in dma_max_mapping_size(dev) as the argument.

Alternatively, if we can be certain that dma_max_mapping_size(dev) never returns 0,
then that 'if (max_segment == 0)' part can just be dropped.

I also wonder if any of the other (non-media) users of sg_alloc_table_from_pages
would need to use sg_alloc_table_from_pages_segment as well. Is this really
media specific? Or is media just the most likely subsystem to hit this issue due
to the large amounts of memory it uses?

Regards,

	Hans
