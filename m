Hey Shengjiu,

first of all thanks for all of this work and I am very sorry for only
emerging this late into the series, I sadly didn't notice it earlier.

I would like to voice a few concerns about the general idea of adding
Audio support to the Media subsystem.

1. The biggest objection is, that the Linux Kernel has a subsystem
specifically targeted for audio devices, adding support for these
devices in another subsystem are counterproductive as they work around
the shortcomings of the audio subsystem while forcing support for a
device into a subsystem that was never designed for such devices.
Instead, the audio subsystem has to be adjusted to be able to support
all of the required workflows, otherwise, the next audio driver with
similar requirements will have to move to the media subsystem as well,
the audio subsystem would then never experience the required change and
soon we would have two audio subsystems.

2. Closely connected to the previous objection, the media subsystem with
its current staff of maintainers is overworked and barely capable of
handling the workload, which includes an abundance of different devices
from DVB, codecs, cameras, PCI devices, radio tuners, HDMI CEC, IR
receivers, etc. Adding more device types to this matrix will make the
situation worse and should only be done with a plan for how first to
improve the current maintainer situation.

3. By using the same framework and APIs as the video codecs, the audio
codecs are going to cause extra work for the video codec developers and
maintainers simply by occupying the same space that was orginally
designed for the purpose of video only. Even if you try to not cause any
extra stress the simple presence of the audio code in the codebase is
going to cause restrictions.

The main issue here is that the audio subsystem doesn't provide a
mem2mem framework and I would say you are in luck because the media
subsystem has gathered a lot of shortcomings with its current
implementation of the mem2mem framework over time, which is why a new
implementation will be necessary anyway.

So instead of hammering a driver into the wrong destination, I would
suggest bundling our forces and implementing a general memory-to-memory
framework that both the media and the audio subsystem can use, that
addresses the current shortcomings of the implementation and allows you
to upload the driver where it is supposed to be.
This is going to cause restrictions as well, like mentioned in the
concern number 3, but with the difference that we can make a general
plan for such a framework that accomodates lots of use cases and each
subsystem can add their routines on top of the general framework.

Another possible alternative is to try and make the DRM scheduler more
generally available, this scheduler is the most mature and in fact is
very similar to what you and what the media devices need.
Which again just shows how common your usecase actually is and how a
general solution is the best long term solution.

Please notice that Daniel Almeida is currently working on something
related to this:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/3F80AC0D-DCAA-4EDE-BF58-BB1369C7EDCA@collabora.com/T/#u

If the toplevel maintainers decide to add the patchset so be it, but I
wanted to voice my concerns and also highlight that this is likely going
to cause extra stress for the video codecs maintainers and the
maintainers in general. We cannot spend a lot of time on audio codecs,
as video codecs already fill up our available time sufficiently,
so the use of the framework needs to be conservative and cause as little
extra work as possible for the original use case of the framework.

Regards,
Sebastian
