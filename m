I also did start implementing how I think this could look last year, though never
got it to work at the time.

Relevant code is at:
	https://github.com/mmind/linux-rockchip/commits/wip/tc358749

especially:
	https://github.com/mmind/linux-rockchip/commit/e0d4b03976d2aab85a8c1630be937ea003b5df88

which allows dsi1 to act like a phy instead as it contains the controls
for the tx1rx1 dphy.


Though I can't say if and when I'll revisit this myself again.
