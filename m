Ack.

Porting my atomisp-ov2680.c changes should get us close to having the standard ov2680.c work on the miix510 (ACPI enumeration, runtime-pm and selection API support will all be added).

I had a tree that "worked" in that you could stream with it but it was very ugly, as I had no idea what I was doing at the time and swiftly got the Surface instead and so moved on to that. The references to OV2680 in the CIO2/INT3472 code are hangovers from that early support really.

Long story short: Can you give me some quick instructions, or a docs pointer for testing a new sensor with libcamera ?Â  Or preferably I guess first outside of libcamera just grabbing raw-bayer + some userspace debayer tool for testing and then later on test under libcamera ?

The easiest way to do it is using the ipu3 utils within the libcamera project, which don't actually use the library itself but rather just configure with media-ctl and capture with yavta. See [1] and [2] for example. Testing within libcamera requires that the driver meet libcamera's requirements [3] which mostly means ensuring it has the 5 mandatory controls, plus some targets for the .get_selection() callback - I can't remember exactly which ones but I think it's CROP, NATIVE_SIZE, CROP_BOUNDS and CROP_DEFAULT. And I think it would also need an entry adding right at [4] to describe the sensor for libcamera. After that the cam tool from libcamera should list it with cam -l and capture from it with cam -cN --capture, or alternatively qcam would display the stream.

Thank you for the testing instructions. I will give this a try once I have all the recent atomisp
improvements ported to the main ov2680 driver and I have the main ov2680 driver working with the atomisp.

Note I send a another reply in that thread yesterday with an alternative suggestion for fixing this (I would like to not have to add any GPIO remapping stuff in INT3472 when possible, IMHO the sensor drivers should be patched to use the right con-ids where possible).

Hans
