I haven't forgotten this, but I was highly distracted.  I wanted to
test a bunch of stuff on omap3630 and imx6 boards to prep them for the
upcoming 5.4 LTS kernel.  As of now I 'think' this is the last item on
my to-do list.

I'm going to try and throw some debug code into the older st/kim
driver as well as debug this.  I know some people have stated they
have wl1283-st working on a dm3730.  dump some logs?  I am curious to
see if there is anything that can be gained by sharing the info.  I'd
love to see the older st/kim drivers deprecated.
