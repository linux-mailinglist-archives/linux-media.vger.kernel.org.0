Ugh, it looks like everyone that calls dvb_attach() is going to be
affected.  I can make up a patch for this later today, unless Christoph
beats me to it :)

Also, in commit 8f569c0b4e6b ("media: dvb-core: add helper functions for
I2C binding"), way back in 2018, it says no one should be using this
function anymore, but given I see over 700 uses of it, that's obviously
not changing any time soon :(

Thanks for testing this.
