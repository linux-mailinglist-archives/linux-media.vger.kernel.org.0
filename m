Converting into a table would require to escape the asterisk, e. g.:

	old_spte = \*spte;

or:

	``old_spte = *spte;``

	(and, for consistency, for all other stuff there)
	

So, yeah, the html/pdf output could be nicer, but it would be worse for those
who read the .rst file.

FYI, there's a way to setup monospaced font on a table by using a template.

As I pointed a while ago, it would require to add something to the
Sphinx theme:

	diff --git a/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css b/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css
	index e21e36cd6761..0948de6651f8 100644
	--- a/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css
	+++ b/Documentation/sphinx-static/theme_overrides.css
	@@ -125,3 +125,7 @@ div[class^="highlight"] pre {
	         color: inherit;
	     }
	 }
	+
	+table.monospaced {
	+	font-family: monospace, monospace;
	+}

Then use, at locking.rst (or anywhere when a monospaced font is desired):

	+.. cssclass:: monospaced

	+ ==== ====== =====
	+ Some Random Table
	+ ==== ====== =====

For completeness, a similar template class should also be needed at 
latex_prefix setting at Documentation/conf.py, implementing the same
feature for LaTeX and PDF output.

IMHO, this would be too complex for not much gain.

Ok.

Maybe we could append the enclosed patch to this one. I suspect it would
visually be better.

Cheers,
Mauro
