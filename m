Why we still care about GOP here. Hardware have no idea about GOP at 
all. Although in codec likes HEVC, IDR and intra pictures's nalu header 
is different, there is not different in the hardware coding 
configration. NALU header is generated by the userspace usually.

While future encoding would regard the current encoded picture as an IDR 
is completed decided by the userspace.

If we the userspace could manage the lifetime of reconstruction 
buffers(assignment, reference), we don't need a command here.

It is just a problem of how to design another request API control 
structure to select which buffers would be used for list0, list1.
