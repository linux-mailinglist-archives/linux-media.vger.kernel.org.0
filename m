I'm not a page pool expert, so hopefully those that are will jump in
and help.

My guess is, this last bit is the important part. Locking. Do ports 1
and port 2 rx and tx run in parallel on different CPUs? Hence do you
need locking?

Maybe, maybe not. It is not really the number of front panel interface
which matters here. It is the number of entities which need buffers.

So you have one entity which needs buffers. CPPI. It seems like Port1
and Port2 do not need buffers? So to me, you need one page pool.

This might be the first time page pool has been used by a switch? I
would check the melanox and sparx5 driver and see if they use page
pool.

You probably need to explain the TX architecture a bit. How are
packets passed to the hardware? Is it again via a single CPPI entity?
Or are there two entities?

DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL and DMA_FROM_DEVICE is about cache flushing and
invalidation. Before you pass a buffer to the hardware for it to
receive into, you need to invalidate the cache. That means when the
hardware gives the buffer back with a packet in it, there is a cache
miss and it fetches the new data from memory. If that packet gets
turned into an XDP_TX, you need to flush the cache to force any
changes out of the cache and into memory. The DMA from memory then
gets the up to date packet contents.

My guess would be, always using DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL is fine, so long as
your cache operations are correct. Turn on DMA_API_DEBUG and make sure
it is happy.
