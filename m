Attention:

I have something very important to discuss with you about inheritance
fund left in my bank with a late customer who worked with shell
development company here in my Country and died along with his family
while on vacation in September 19,2017 Earthquake in Central Mexico
that killed over 370 people leaving the sum of (USD$14 Million United
States Dollars) behind in our Bank.

I write to you because he has the same last name with you which I do
not know if he is a member of your family.I am Michel Koffi Dorkenoo a
banker and the director of operation of the said bank where the fund
was deposited. I will like you to contact me so we can talk more about
this because from the bank record I understand that someone has
contacted you because of the fund in the past and try to cheat on you
that is why I stopped the transfer for some months now but am ready to
work directly with you on trust and understanding I promise to
transfer the fund to you through  ATM-VISA-CARD  or bank to bank
online transfer direct to your account in your country only if you can
work with me as I will advice you on what you need to do to receive
the fund and the share ratio.

I will wait for your urgent response direct t me email (
bankbess@gmail.com ) or you can add me on whatsapp number
(+228-9688-6703) for more details.

Mr Michael Koffi Dorkenoo
Director Of Operation
GOD BLESS YOU
