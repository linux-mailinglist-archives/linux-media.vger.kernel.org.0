Just to add some numbers to add some context:

 V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC for BULK and ISO will be delayed from:
```
Triggered immediately when the reception of a frame has begun
```
one urb.

For bulk devices this is a maximum of 0.05 msec (32KiB/600MBps)
For 1MiB transfer isoc devices (which is the biggest we have seen),
that is 1.8 msec.
In both cases, this is smaller than the jitter to process the event
itself by userspace.

The time from V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC to DQBUF is around 30 msec.

I do not know how much delay is considered acceptable... but if we
take the delay argument to the extreme, we could say that
V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC can never be implemented, because the event will
always be delayed by something.
