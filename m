Hi, thanks for your reply.

the hardware code here,
https://github.com/caihuoq/nvdla-hw
or https://github.com/nvdla/hw
which includes cmodel, RTL.

I also make a docker image to run cmodel simulator(based on qemu)
https://github.com/caihuoq/nvdla_docker
It can be used to check this driver.

Thanks,
Cai
