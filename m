Yes, [1] goes in the right direction. The V4L2_EVENT_XFER_ERROR addition can
be dropped, since a call to vb2_queue_error() is sufficient for non-recoverable
transfer errors.

BTW, I think a timer might work better than a workqueue here: no need to cancel
and reschedule the workqueue in interrupt context, instead the isr can just call
mod_timer. Calling vb2_queue_error can be done from interrupt context as well,
so that can safely be called from the timer function.

I would not be opposed to keep this as driver-specific functionality: it's really
not much code. But if you do want to add this to vb2, then that can be done, of
course. I think vb2_queue needs a new field: watchdog_timeout. If 0, there is no
watchdog running, if non-0 vb2 would start a timer after start_streaming (and
stop it in stop_streaming), and a new vb2_watchdog_reset() is added that calls
mod_timer and that the driver has to call from the interrupt.

Finally, the timer function would call vb2_queue_error().

Eventually, a vb2_queue op can be added as well (e.g. watchdog_timeout) to do
driver specific stuff. It doesn't seem to be needed for rcar-vin, though.
