I already thought about a way to remove the firmware load on suspend if 
it has not happened earlier. But I saw no way to distinguish between 
calls to si2168_init() during resume and calls to si2168_init() at the 
start of device usage.

In contrast to struct dvb_tuner_ops the relevant struct dvb_frontend_ops 
has no separate members "suspend" and "resume" to store callbacks to be 
called instead of sleep and init during suspend and resume. Changing the 
behavior of si2168 would likely include some bigger architectural work 
on the dvb_frontend system to extend dvb_frontend_ops.
It might be possible to just put nothing into dvb_frontend_ops.init but 
instead populate the dvb_tuner_ops part of the struct, but those 
pointers might already be populated externally for some other use.

If I try to do this on my very first kernel contribution without 
in-depth knowledge of how the dvb drivers really work, this will likely 
just explode, if not for me then for somebody else with different hardware.

Yes, this is exactly what I wanted to say.

A new installation of Fedora 32 without firmware files and with nouveau 
did not show my freeze problem. Installing either the firmware files or 
the nvidia driver started the freeze during resume.

According to my previous observations, an alternative to having the 
nouveau driver fetch files to prevent the freeze when no files are 
installed is to manually run "ls" on the firmware directory.

I will check this corner case again in depth tonight or tomorrow and 
will report my findings, at least as far as it is externally observable 
without in-depth understanding of the internals.

As I have written above, I likely would have tried that, had I found a 
way to distinguish between calls to init during resume and other calls 
to that function.
Do you know of any safe way to detect that a resume operation is going on?

As a pointer to this function goes into the "init" member of the 
dvb_frontend_ops struct, the name seems to be appropriate, at least at 
the moment.

This sounds even better, although I don't really understand your theory.
