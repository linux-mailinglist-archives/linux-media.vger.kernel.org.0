Before I reply, my context is that I'm using these patches from
Mediatek on ChromeOS to implement secure video playback.

The memory range is defined in the firmware. The TEE is configured
with the same address/size that is being set in this DT node. (so
based on comments already, this is appropriate to put in the DT).

I don't think there is any SVP (Secure Video Path) case in the current
kernel. I agree this shouldn't be a Mediatek specific setting, as this
could be usable to other SVP implementations.

I do think this should have 'cma' in the DT description, as it does
relate to what the driver is going to do with this memory region. It
will establish it as a CMA region in Linux. The reason it needs to be
a CMA region is that the entire memory region will need to transition
between secure (i.e. TEE owned) and non-secure (i.e. kernel owned).
Some chipsets have the ability to change memory states between secure
& non-secure at page level granularity, and in these cases you don't
need to worry about having a CMA region like this. That is not the
case on the Mediatek chips where there is a limit to how many regions
you can mark as secure. In order to deal with that limitation, once a
secure allocation needs to be performed, the kernel driver allocates
the entire CMA region so nothing else will use it. Then it marks that
whole region secure and the TEE can do its own allocations from that
region. When all those allocations are freed, it can mark that region
as non-secure again, drop the whole CMA allocation and the kernel can
make use of that CMA region again.  (there is the other dma-heap in
their patches, which is for a smaller region that can always be
secure...but that one is a permanent carveout, the CMA region is
available to the kernel while not in use for secure memory)

So maybe something like:

+title:Secure Reserved CMA Region
+
+description:
+  This binding describes a CMA region that can dynamically transition
between secure and non-secure states that a TEE can allocate memory
from.
