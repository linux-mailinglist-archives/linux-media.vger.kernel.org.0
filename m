Hello,

This small series fixes two issues with video adjustments (brightness,
contrast, saturation and hue) in the adv7604 driver. Patch 1/2 makes
those controls effective (they currently have no effect), and patch 2/2
fixes the range of the hue control.

I have successfully tested the series with an ADV7612. The ADV7604 and
ADV7611 documentation of the hue control differs from the ADV7612, but I
believe that's because earlier documentation was incorrect. It could
still be useful to test the series with an ADV7604 or ADV7611.

In patch 2/2 I've decided to represent the hue value as an unsigned
8-bit integer, mapping to the [0째, 360째[ range. Using a signed value
would map to the [-180째, 180째[ range instead, without making any other
difference (and without requiring any modification to the patch other
than changing the range). I don't have a strong preference between the
two options, and I'm pretty sure we can freely pick one without any fear
of an impact on existing userspace applications as patch 1/2 shows that
the hue control has currently no effect.
