If the GPIO is requested is output and the pin in the HiZ mode, what value
should you return?

No, input and HiZ are two different states. If the hardware doesn't
support the latter, then your patch doesn't make any difference indeed, except
involving "in" buffer for "out" value. Which I consider an unneeded
step instead of reading [cached] "out" value.

[cached] here is used in a broader sense: either SW cache, or read back value
from the GPIO out register (not all hardware support that).

Right, but for push-pull mode this is not needed, correct?

There are couple of remarks above:
1) what to read at the real HiZ mode ("in" and "out" buffers are disconnected
   from the pin) in case hardware supports it;
2) why to read "out" value via "in" buffer in case of push-pull mode.
