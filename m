Being subscribed to the linux-uvc-devel list, and seeing that it's a
black hole where people post, and unfortunately get very little to no
response I certainly concur that it needs to be changed.

I don't think we can guarantee a better response with linux-media, but
at least it's the right place, where the driver is actually maintained.

So I also believe it should be moved to linux-media.
