I don't have wifi or bluetooth enabled in the BIOS. If I don't use the 
nouveau driver, "dmesg | grep firmware" is completely empty after boot 
except for the kernel command line part "ddebug_query=module 
firmware_class +pmf". After suspend + resume I just get two lines for 
the calls to cache and uncache firmwares. If any other firmware is used, 
it is apparently not using the standard firmware loader.
If I rename the directory /usr/lib/firmware everything seems to work as 
before (nouveau and si2168 not loaded) and I don't see any complaints 
about missing firmware in dmesg.

If I enable my secondary rtl8125 Ethernet controller in the BIOS (I only 
tested this now, I always had it disabled previously), I can see its 
firmware being loaded on boot and cached on suspend. This then has an 
effect on my freeze problem identical to using the nouveau driver.

A freeze can happen on resume with and without the si2168 firmware files 
installed. It however is easier to hit the freeze with the firmware 
files installed. Without the firmware files present the freeze happens 
only if no other driver uses the firmware loader.

I'm totally sure that no other firmware is used through the standard 
firmware loader. I'm also almost sure that no firmware from 
/usr/lib/firmware is used though any other means.

Will you do it yourself or do you expect me to do anything for this?

I confirmed that above. Why is this so important, anyway?
