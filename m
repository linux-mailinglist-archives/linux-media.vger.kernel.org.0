Thanks, will fix in v2.

I agree, if this is still valid it is not something that should prevent
this driver from moving out of staging.

There is however one remaining feature/issue that is not listed in TODO.

In certain situations the hw block may need a reset after there has been
a decoding error, especially after a hevc decoding error. Decoding can
typically be re-started with successful result after a short pm
autosuspend timeout.

We do have a soft/hard reset implementation in LibreELEC-distro,
excluded it from this series because reset is typically not needed, and
I think the reset code need some rework to be upstream ready.

Would missing hard reset support be a reason for keeping this driver
in staging?

Jonas
