Ah, I thought you had suggested using a new one. Yes, I'll use the existing
macro.

Still having them exactly the same is of utmost importance and a common
definition reliably achieves that. What the string actually is is of
secondary importance.

I disagree. Do you know if studies have been made on the topic?

I can make some a little longer if that makes you happy (depending on other
comments, too), but I won't make the lines e.g.  200 characters long.

The other assignments take place just before this, so it's closer to them. I

Yes, in v2.
