Please have a look at memfd and the seal feature, it does cover the reason =
why
unsealed shared memory require full trust. For controls, the SEAL_WRITE is =
even
needed, as with appropriate timing, a malicous process can modify the data =
in-
between validation and allocation, causing possible memory overflow.

https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/memfd_create.2.html
File sealing
       In the absence of file sealing, processes that communicate via
       shared memory must either trust each other, or take measures to
       deal with the possibility that an untrusted peer may manipulate
       the shared memory region in problematic ways.  For example, an
       untrusted peer might modify the contents of the shared memory at
       any time, or shrink the shared memory region.  The former
       possibility leaves the local process vulnerable to time-of-check-
       to-time-of-use race conditions (typically dealt with by copying
       data from the shared memory region before checking and using it).
       The latter possibility leaves the local process vulnerable to
       SIGBUS signals when an attempt is made to access a now-
       nonexistent location in the shared memory region.  (Dealing with
       this possibility necessitates the use of a handler for the SIGBUS
       signal.)

       Dealing with untrusted peers imposes extra complexity on code
       that employs shared memory.  Memory sealing enables that extra
       complexity to be eliminated, by allowing a process to operate
       secure in the knowledge that its peer can't modify the shared
       memory in an undesired fashion.

       [...]

regards,
Nicolas
