Well the be honest the scope of work on our side is really centered on PX30
and merging this first version.

Indeed I think we want to try avoid that. Another common option is to define
capability flags to represent differences between generations in a more
practical and clean way than explicitly checking chip ids or so.

Switching from video node-centric to MC-centric is more of a semantic chang=
e.
In the first case we expect that subdevs are configured by the video device
driver and userspace is not expected to change anything in the media topolo=
gy
or to configure media entities explicitly.

In the latter case it's the opposite : the driver should never try to push
configuration to a subdev and should instead validate that the current
configuration makes sense.

Still, I believe should be a media device registered and visible to userspa=
ce.
Mehdi could you take a look at this? Do you see a media device in `media-ct=
l -p`
and /dev/mediaX?

Cheers,

Paul
