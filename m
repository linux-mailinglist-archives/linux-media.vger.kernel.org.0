Yes, I do. Actually, I currently have two forms of a green tint, on my
OV13850 everything is quite dark and greenish, which is caused by the
missing 3A algorithms. On my OV4689, I have big patches of the image
with bright green color and flickering, I investigated if this is
connected to the 2nd ISP instance, but that doesn't seem to be the case
as I have the same results when I switch the CSI ports of the cameras.

I have found another issue, while testing I discovered following
issue:
When I start the system with an HDMI monitor connected, then the camera
on the 2nd port doesn't work. This is probably because the RX/TX is
reserved as a TX.
But it made me wonder because if the system has an RX, a TX, and
an RX/TX, why isn't the pure TX used by the monitor and the
cameras take RX and RX/TX?
Or do you think that this is maybe a malfunction of this patch?
