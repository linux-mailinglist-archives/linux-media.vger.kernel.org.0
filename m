A combo of v4l2-ctl and v4l2-compliance. In v4l-utils you find a test-media
script in contrib/test that tests the various virtual v4l2 drivers, including
vicodec.

Basically you want to run the same (or at least as much as possible) vicodec
tests for this virtio driver in a linux guest VM.

The script uses the vicodec encoder to create test streams, but in the VM you
can also load vicodec and use it to do the same thing, which can then be fed
to the virtio driver who passes it to the vicodec instance running on the host,
and the result goes back to the VM.

It would be a great setup to check the corner cases and verify the results of
the codec. And it can be added to kernel-ci and my own daily regression test.

	Hans
