So for wave5 we will opt for this and apply your suggested changes. And I m=
ay
come back later on the subject.

In this case, "buffered" is used to disable the checks for having at least =
one
buffer in the ready queues. In most cases, if you don't have at least 1 pen=
ding
capture and 1 pending output buffer, there is no point in calling device_ru=
n.

In reality, drivers will add use case specific checks in their job_ready()
implementation. For decoders, the cases I can think of are:

- On capture if you haven't parsed the stream header
- On capture if the driver removes them from ready queue as a way to track =
which
one are considered free and may be used at any time by the firmware
- On output queue, if you need device_run() to be called to complete the dr=
ain
the reorder queue

Yet, you want this check after stream headers are parsed, or whenever a new
bitstream decode operation is to be queued in the firmware. So this check g=
ets
re-implemented, but dynamically, in all decoders.

Deinterlacers may needs this too with some algorithms (the one that introdu=
ce
delays at least). Its not clear to me why it was called buffered,
ignore_rdy_queue might have been an option, though I'm not fully confident.=
 Note
that M2M can be confusing, since whenever you ask for last something, its a=
lways
relative to the ready queue, and may not make a lot of sense in the context=
 it
is used.

I can see you have omitted mark_stopped() calles when refactoring, which ma=
kes
these patches change the behaviour. Could be related.

This is no longer strictly related to this patch, but I think cmd_stop()
implementation (even after your changes) are miss-fit for driver that speak=
s to
firmware. As the firmware is being made aware of the free buffers, you can'=
t
just cherry-pick from the capture queue, you have to synchronise your state=
 with
the firmware while draining. The helper should be split in two parts I supp=
ose,
but cutting the line isn't easy.

Thread safe usage of the numerous boolean implicated in the draining state =
is
also difficult. There is no other option then introduce a mutex or spinlock=
 (if
the state is needed in job_ready() implementation) to make this thread safe=
 and
reliable.
