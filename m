If only V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE is set, then only the colorspace
field from userspace is applied. Which is almost certainly wrong
sicne switching between the colorspace that is received and the
colorspace that you want requires complex calculations. And if a
device can do that, then it certainly can also allow userspace to
override the other three colorimetry fields. So setting just
V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE makes no sense.

The V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* flags come into play if you want to allow
userspace to convert the colorimetry of the captured data to another
colorimetry. That's often not supported, the colorimetry fields are
just filled in based on what was captured. Often there is some support
to convert between YCBCR/RGB/QUANTIZATION settings, so such devices
can set V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_YCBCR_ENC | V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_QUANTIZATION
if they want. This is typically a 3x3 matrix + one vector in the hardware.

No, the driver is saying that it can convert to another colorspace
if requested to do so by userspace, while leaving the xfer function,
ycbcr encoding and quantization range untouched.

That's a highly unlikely situation, and I think it's likely a bug
in the driver. It should probably drop that flag.

No. First of all, unless one or more of the V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* flags are
set, the driver fills in these fields, and ignores what userspace
filled in. So [1] just describes what these fields mean, and that you
can use those DEFAULT macros to determine what the actual xfer_func,
ycbcr_enc or quantization is if the driver left those values to 0.

What those defaults are depends on the chosen colorspace field.

So if this flag is set, then userspace can ask the driver to convert
to specific colorimetry settings, if supported (what is supported is
indicated by the V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* flags returned by ENUM_FMT).

This relates to a capture device, so for an m2m device that means
the colorimetry that userspace set for the output device.

A typical m2m device will just copy the colorimetry fields from output
to capture format. If you want it to act as a csc device, then it will
have to advertise the relevant V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* flags.

If it converts between different pixelformats (e.g. RGB to YUV), then
there is an implicit csc step, of course, but the result will be using
the default rules.

Example: userspace passes a frame with V4L2_COLORSPACE_BT2020, V4L2_XFER_FUNC_709,
V4L2_YCBCR_ENC_DEFAULT (n/a) and V4L2_QUANTIZATION_FULL_RANGE, and wants
a NV12 back. The colorimetry for that will be V4L2_COLORSPACE_BT2020,
V4L2_XFER_FUNC_709, V4L2_YCBCR_ENC_BT2020 (most likely, hw limitations might
force this to 709 or 601) and V4L2_QUANTIZATION_LIM_RANGE.

So this is all determined by the driver, not userspace.

So, to recap:

1) for an m2m device it is userspace that provides the colorimetry data
   in the output format. For a regular capture device it is the
   video receiver driver that sets it (typically determined by the
   sensor driver or a video receiver driver).
2) Implicit CSC conversion might take place when converting between
   different pixel formats. Typically this will only affect the
   ycbcr_enc and quantization fields, since that's usually all that
   is supported. The colorspace and xfer_func fields are just copied
   from the output pixelformat.
3) If explicit CSC conversion is signaled by the driver by setting
   V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* flags, then userspace can request specific
   colorimetry results, and the hardware will be configured by the
   driver to give that result.

I hope this helps!
