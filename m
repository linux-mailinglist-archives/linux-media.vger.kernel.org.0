Hello everyone,

Here's a set of patches that turn the existing SMIA driver into a MIPI CCS
driver while maintaining SMIA support. A number of bugs in the existing
code are fixed in this set, too.

The changes at this point are primarily focused on dealing with new
mandatory driver features related to PLL configuration (as CCS allows for
much more variation there) and things such as integer conversion from
U16.U16 format instead of float. There are some other new features as well
such as digital gain and support for getting device specific analogue gain
coefficients.

A new feature in CCS is CCS static data which makes it possible to obtain
sensor's capabilities and limits from a file chosen based on sensor
identification. CCS static data is used also for storing MSR registers so
supporting new, CCS compliant devices requires no driver changes.

Also DT bindings are updated accordingly and converted to YAML format.

More information on MIPI CCS can be found here:

<URL:https://www.mipi.org/specifications/camera-command-set>

Comments are welcome.

since the big, big patchset (v2):

- Split into more easily reviewable chunks (this is the first of maybe
  three). The cover page describes the entire big set. This set contains
  support for additional configurability, more bugfixes, power sequence
  alignment with CCS and other tasks postponed in earlier patches.

- Added more documentation (driver, controls, PLL calculator).

- Switch from C99 integer types to Linux types.

- Fix file order in MAINTAINERS.

- Revert MODULE_LICENSE change to "GPL" -> "GPL v2"

- Support automatic PHY control, and default to it instead of using
  UI-based control.

- Remove V4L2_CID_CCS_LUMINANCE_SHADING_CORRECTION and
  V4L2_CID_CCS_SHADING_CORRECTION_CAPABILITY controls. This way we don't
  tell all the device capabilities to the user but it's unlikely anyone
  will really want to know this part precisely.

- Align with CCS power-on sequence.

- Don't do software reset if we have a reset GPIO.

- Bail out in probe if the external clock frequency is zero.

- Activate the luminance control only when shading correction is enabled.
