I'd take lower performing but correct than fast and broken. :)

Syncing for CPU/device is about making sure the CPU/device can see
the data produced by the other. Some devices might be dma-coherent
and syncing for them would be a NOP, but we cant know that here
in this driver. Let's say we have two attached devices, one that
is cache coherent and one that isn't. If we only sync for first
attached device then that is converted to a NOP and we never flush
like the second device needed.

Same is true for devices behind IOMMU or with an L3 cache when
syncing in the other direction for CPU. So we have to sync for all
attached devices to ensure we get even the lowest common denominator
device sync'd. It is up to the DMA-API layer to decide which syncs
need to actually do something. If all attached devices are coherent
then all syncs will be NOPs and we have no performance penalty.

Seems like a constraint solving micro-optimization. The DMA-API layer
would have to track which buffers have already been flushed from CPU
cache and also track that nothing has been written into those caches
since that point, only then could it skip the flush. But that is already
the point of the dirty bit in the caches themselves, cleaning already
clean cache lines is essentially free in hardware. And so is invalidating
lines, it is just flipping a bit.
