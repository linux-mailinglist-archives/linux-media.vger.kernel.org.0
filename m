SoC cameras == YUV/RGB sensors ?

Are you thinking about using the actual exposure time for YUV/RGB
sensors ?

Apparently only 2 drivers in mainline register V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE_ABSOLUTE

I would indeed be happy with something like "The suggested unit for
the control is lines"

I might have missed why the gain being linear or not has implications
on the fact it acts as a multiplication factor for the color
channels...
