There's *some* value; I'm just skeptical since only three drivers use
it.

IORESOURCE_EXCLUSIVE is from e8de1481fd71 ("resource: allow MMIO
exclusivity for device drivers"), and the commit message says this is
only active when CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM is set.  I didn't check to see
whether that's still true.

That commit adds a bunch of wrappers and "__"-prefixed functions to
pass the IORESOURCE_EXCLUSIVE flag around.  That's a fair bit of
uglification for three drivers.

You're right, many drivers don't call pci_request_regions().  Maybe we
could do better, but I haven't looked into that recently.  There is a
related note in Documentation/PCI/pci.rst that's been there for a long
time (it refers to "pci_request_resources()", which has never existed
AFAICT).  I'm certainly open to proposals.
