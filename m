It is the other way around, meson default to what ld.so.conf (your distribution)
is configured to. In this case you are running a debian/unbutu system, and this
is the proper path for multi-arch library placement.

If you try this on Fedora with a 64bit CPU, it would have picked
/usr/local/lib64. Which is also the proper path for that Linux distribution.
Debian has a more complex way, but it covers more use cases.

Each projects have their own opinion on this. I believe debugoptimize is the
right default. Here's how GStreamer project is setup (very first line of the
meson code):

project('gstreamer', 'c',
  version : '1.19.1.1',
  meson_version : '>= 0.54',
  default_options : [ 'warning_level=1',
                      'buildtype=debugoptimized' ])

This is trivially straightforward and I understood Ariel will fix it in next
version. Thanks for spotting.

We can and should definitely do that same.
