It will be the first thing that vb2_streamon calls. This has nothing to do
with start_streaming: that's called when sufficient number of buffers are
queued up to be able to start the DMA. This proposed prepare_streaming op
will be called when VIDIOC_STREAMON is called.

I'll make an RFC patch for vb2 so you have a better idea of what it does.
