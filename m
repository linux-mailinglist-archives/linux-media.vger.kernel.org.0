Alternative proposal:

1) Add support for fractions (struct v4l2_fract) as a control type:
   V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_FRACT.

2) Add a new V4L2_CID_MPEG_FRAME_INTERVAL control.

Encoders shall support this control.

3) For backwards compatibility reasons encoder drivers still have to
support G/S_PARM, but this can now be implemented by standard helpers
that query this control. Drivers also have to implement ENUM_FRAMEINTERVALS.
If the range of intervals is always the same regardless of the frame size,
then a helper can be used that queries the min/max/step of the control, but
if it is dependent on the frame size, then it has to be implemented in the
driver itself.

I'm sticking to frame intervals instead of frame rates for the simple reason
that that's what V4L2 has used since the beginning. I think it is too confusing
to change this to a frame rate. This is just my opinion, though.

I also chose to make this a codec control, not a generic user control: this
value together with the bit rate control(s) determine the compression size,
it does not determine the actual time it takes for the encoder to compress
the raw frames. Hence it is really not the same thing as the frame interval
of a video capture device. If we want to use a control for that as well in
the future as a replacement for G/S_PARM, then that should be a new control.
And we would like need per-pad controls as well in order to implement that.
Which is a lot more work.

Regards,

	Hans
