Hello Joe,

Right. In general, I don't do that (for that very reason), however in
drivers/media this looks like a common practice and I didn't want to
break it.

Right. However, such a name helps looking this up in the docs.
E.g. the register name in the docs is "hispi_control_status" and the
bitfield is "framer_test_mode" or something like that.
Since it's just one register (+ value) and it actually fits in 80
columns without too much problems, I'd rather like to leave it
unchanged.

Well, personally I think we could all switch to VT100's 132 columns.
Introduced in '78 :-) That's what I currently use for non-kernel tasks
(not the VT100 but just the line length). OTOH I'm using that emacs
wrapping mode so longer lines aren't a problem either.
But here, in drivers/media, I'm told 80 column is strict.

Right. Unfortunately anything else would mean recoding.

It's another custom in drivers/media, but I guess I don't have to follow
it closely, do I? I never liked the #define.

TBH I've never used ftrace.
It appears that it can't show the arguments, can it?
If not, I'd rather leave these dev_dbg()s in place - like other
drivers/media/* in fact.
However obviously the code without deb_dbg()s would be cleaner, so if
ftrace can show the (formatted) arguments, I'm all for it.

Thanks for looking at this,
