как хорошо, что по-русски можно писать то, что думаешь

Might seem so to you, but apparently not to those wondering.

US is just another victim of those trotzkist slugs --
you can ask your father, he must know better *why*
those have been expelled even by their own ilk
a century ago here in Russia.

Linus, those "news" have cost your family a child already,
and Elon has paid a similar tax.  You have been limited in
your right to tell what you think right here in linux-kernel@
(unless you speak hate against *all* of the Russians, yeah).

You've agreed that black is white and vice versa.  It is not.

It's not about the patch but rather about the attitude;
Documentation/process/code-of-conduct-interpretation.rst:

"regardless of ... ethnicity, ... nationality, ... race"
"Focusing on what is best for the community"

"Examples of unacceptable behavior ... insulting/derogatory
comments ... Public or private harassment"

Get back to single-standard integrity for yor own's sake.

Have you heard of casus belli?  Do you think these were one?

http://nypost.com/2022/02/21/russia-kills-5-ukrainian-saboteurs-allegedly-trying-to-breach-border/
http://reuters.com/world/europe/russias-fsb-says-shell-ukrainian-territory-destroys-russian-border-guard-post-2022-02-21/

That's February 21, 2022.  If I yelled all over the place
about "Finnish invasion" after Russian IFVs have rovered
Finland *first* for no good reason, would I be right?

Feel free to ask, I actually grew up in Kiev and e.g.
this bug fix was done there as well:

http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15658
http://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip.git/commit/?id=c9e2fbd909c20b165b2b9ffb59f8b674cf0a55b0

Please do revert it too then.

Drop Linux network stack while at that, that "roomful
of Russian mathematicians" is now declared untermensch.

On your side, Linus.
On your side.

Hope you're still Finnish, not a Finnish nazi
(swap "Russians" with "Jews" in your email and
re-read it; it's my homegrown "nazi test" --
if this change suddenly makes a text "nazist",
it was).

It is the US that has pushed Finland towards NATO,
basically to follow the grim destiny that the former
Ukraine currently harvests, and that was prepared
for Georgia (that evades it), Moldavia (that rishes
full speed towards destruction), Poland, the three
Baltic states, and now your homeland.

There is no regulation that can force your own heart.
Listen to it.  Not to emotions, but to the deep truth
that never cries aloud.

You bow to the jerks who are *afraid* of opposition,
because there is no truth in their father.

Remember those who yelled "Assad must go"?
How many of them are still around?
Those siding with them perish with them.


PS: last time I've seen RMS in Moscow, he declared
his support "to the Moscow protesters"; I've asked him
whether he knows that the initial issue was that the
dead people were identified en masse as those "voting"
for "democratic" candidates in 2019 elections, and he
stared at me and answered, "nonsense".  I've emailed
him after BLM affairs to ask if what he sees makes
sense but never seen a reply this time -- and dead
voters turned out to be not a purely export-only
"technology" a bit later (pretty cosmopolitan).
