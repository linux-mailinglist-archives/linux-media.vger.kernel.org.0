Any idea why this hasn't been seen/reported before? According to git blame
that mutex_lock has been there since 2013. Does nobody test with
CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP? Am I really the first to encounter this?

Before spending time on this I'd like to be sure that, yes, I'm really the
first in 8 years to see this, and this wasn't introduced by something else.

RCU seems like a reasonable alternative, but I will have to read up on it
since it's the first time I'll be using this. All those quizzes in the RCU
docs (1) scare the hell out of me :-)
