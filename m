Can I point out how terrible an idea this is? The C language gives 
virtually zero guarantee about how bitfields are actually represented in 
memory. Platform ABIs (e.g. [1]) might nail things down a bit more, but 
different platforms are free to make completely different choices so 
portability still goes out the window. Even for a single platform, 
different compilers (or at worst even different version of one compiler) 
can still make incompatible choices e.g. WRT alignment of packed 
members. Even if you narrow the scope as far as a specific version of 
AArch64 GCC, I think this is still totally broken for big-endian.

The fact that you've had to use nonsensical types to trick a compiler 
into meeting your expectations should already be a clue to how fragile 
this is in general.

Similarly, Linux bitmaps are designed for use as, well, bitmaps. Abusing 
them as a data interchange format for bit-aligned numerical values is 
far from "clean" semantically. And I'm pretty sure it's also broken for 
big-endian.

This kind of stuff may be standard practice in embedded development 
where you're targeting a specific MCU with a specific toolchain, but I 
don't believe it's suitable for upstream Linux. It would take pretty 
much the same number of lines to use GENMASK definitions and bitfield.h 
helpers to pack values into words which can then be written to memory in 
a guaranteed format and endianness (certainly for the PPS; for the RPS 
it may well end up a bit longer, but would be self-documenting and 
certainly more readable than those loops). It mostly just means that for 
any field which crosses a word boundary you'll end up with 2 definitions 
and 2 assignments, which is hardly a problem (and in some ways more 
honest about what's actually going on).

Thanks,
Robin.
