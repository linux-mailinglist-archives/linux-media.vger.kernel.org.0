In DT case it's up to the driver to do that, so the device is powered off.

I don't think it is as what's missing is the desired power state during
probe, i.e. whether or not the device will be powered on. It wasn't there
in ACPI either before it was added.

The problem is slightly lesser on DT though as it's up to the driver
whether or not to power on the device. In the example I gave above,
however, e.g. the at24 driver can't be modified to keep the device powered
off and at the same time expected people would remain content with it. So
this information should come from firmware.
