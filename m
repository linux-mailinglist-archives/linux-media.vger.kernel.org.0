I'm wondering where these four values come from. They set the
TP_WINDOW_WIDTH and TP_WINDOW_HEIGHT registers to 1640 and 1232
respectively, which seems to have been copied from the 1640x1232 mode.
Are they right for the 640x480 mode ? All the other modes set those two
registers to the same values as X_OUTPUT_SIZE and Y_OUTPUT_SIZE.
