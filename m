I'm missing a 'Signed-off-by' here, please add this in a v2.

Split this patch up into two separate patches, one for each .rst file.

As I mentioned on, I think, irc, I disagree with calling this an array.
I prefer the original phrase 'enumerate all frame sizes'. This is consistent
as well with other ENUM ioctls. This applies to the other 'array' references
below as well. Just keep the original text.

> +a sub-device on the selected pad for the selected media bus format.

I'd use 'specified' instead of 'selected' or 'given' since the application
specifies this information.

Stick to 'application' instead of 'caller'. That's the terminology used elsewhere
in the documentation as well, changing what it is called is just more confusing.

I'll take another, closer look at this once v2 is posted. The documentation certainly
can be better, but changing terminology inconsistent with what is used elsewhere in
the media documentation is not helping.

You should also consider changing vidioc-subdev-enum-frame-interval.rst which is
closely related to these two documentation files. If changes are made, then it
should probably be done to all three.

Regards,
