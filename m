Fedora does come with firmware files for many devices (wifi, nouveau, …) 
but not for dvb devices. Firmware for the si2168 has to be installed as 
an extra package dvb-firmware from rpmfusion. When I talk about "no 
firmware files" or "install the firmware files" I mean the si2168 (and 
other dvb hardware) firmware files only. The nouveau firmware files are 
always present.

no, I'm talking just about the firmware files for si2168

This statement for me seems different compared to the statement in your 
last mail which I agreed to.
In the case that I *don't* have the firmware files for si2168 (!) 
present it happens only if no other firmware is cached on suspend (in my 
case by the nouveau driver). No statement made about cases where the 
si2168 firmware file is present.

Correct. I have not seen a freeze on suspend. It only happens on resume.

OK, let's try that again. To freeze during resume all of 1-4 has to be true:
1. /usr/lib/firmware is on btrfs
2. my Hauppauge WinTV-dualHD USB DVB tuner (contains si2168) is connected
3. have not actively used the tuner
4. any of the following cases:
4a) si2168 firmware not installed + nouveau driver not used + have not 
run "ls -R /usr/lib/firmware" before suspend
4b) firmware file installed + not run "cat /usr/lib/firmware/dvb*"
4c) firmware file installed + not run "ls -R /usr/lib/firmware" + not 
nouveau driver


Not leading to a freeze is:

A: si2168 firmware not installed + nouveau driver used
B: si2168 firmware not installed + run "ls -R /usr/lib/firmware" before 
suspend
C: used the tuner before suspend (or tried to use, in case that the 
si2168 firmware is not installed)
D: using my patches with firmware_request_cache()
E: si2168 firmware installed + "ls -R /usr/lib/firmware" + "cat 
/usr/lib/firmware/dvb*"
F: si2168 firmware installed + nouveau driver used + "cat 
/usr/lib/firmware/dvb*"

I verified all cases again to make sure I was not remembering anything 
wrong.

The nouveau driver in use seems to be equivalent to running "ls -R 
/usr/lib/firmware" before suspend.

All the cases seem to boil down to:
It freezes if the file system has to be accessed to list the content of 
/usr/lib/firmware or to read the si2168 firmware file
