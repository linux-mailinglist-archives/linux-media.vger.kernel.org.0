As I also mentioned on another thread, sorry, I failed to add people
to Cc who I should have definitly added...

And I might have sent all of the emails to people who I should not
by blindly using `scripts/get_maintainer.pl` for the first patch with
`--cc-cmd`...

Sorry if that's the case for some of you...

Thanks! and I'm glad you're also interested in this!

What I did is rather, as soon as I set up chroot environment on Android
kernel (mipad2), I gave up writing userspace tools by myself and searched
for an existing ones :D

Thanks. It's great if this series is tested by many upstream devs.

I'm glad to hear that you also got a mipad2 :) It might be a interesting
device to look into. It even won't boot without nomodeset, no battery
charging/status on mainline kernel.

By the way, instead of adding whiskey cove regulator driver, we may also
add a "hack" like the other PMIC in atomisp_gmin_platform to control
regulators [1].

It seems that to do so, it needs to "read" value from the PMIC before
writing. So, I'm not sure if this can be achieved easily with the current
mainline kernel though.
