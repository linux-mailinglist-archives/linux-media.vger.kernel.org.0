Oh, I didn't realise there were FOSS implementations of the other side
that tie in with this secure/restricted heap here. Sorry.

I think the patch series cover letter should point to those to give a
view of the other side to the reviewers, just like DRM requires
userspace to be open for new UAPI.

Yes, but "restricted" also does not give out an immediate wrong
impression. Label something as "secure", and it immediately raises the
questions of what kind of attacks it prevents and how can I make use of
it.

Is there any use of restricted buffers outside of Digital Rights
Management though? Could a private person somehow make use of it to
protect their own contents? Like a photographer sending drafts to a
customer while not wanting give out any digital copies?

If not, then restricted buffers are something people would generally
like to avoid, not embrace. "Secure" gives a positive impression,
"restricted" a negative impression.

I would. I'm also just a by-stander, not a maintainer of kernel
anything. I have no power to accept nor reject anything here.

I just generally dislike locking people out of what their systems hold,
but I also understand why extremely big companies want this Digital
Rights Management technology for their business model. If Linux does
not support that business model, they and the whole broadcast industry
might use something else. At least it pays for kernel developers who
can hopefully do some genuinely useful work on the side as well,
benefiting the community.

Let's just be honest about what is what.
