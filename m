Not Mainline, but for the the RK3399 Encoder there is some initial work
available made by bootlin.

https://github.com/bootlin/linux bootlin/hantro/h264-encoding-v5.11

They also implemented some initial userspace tool to test this.

https://github.com/bootlin/v4l2-hantro-h264-encoder

If you have some time on your hands, it would be great if we could test
this on the RK3568 with the VEPU121 core.

well.

I would like to describe the whole sitation a little bit more in detail.

In the Datasheet of the RK3568 there are several decoder and encoder
entities documented. This encoder instance is called VEPU121 in the
TRM.

RK3568:
-------

Look into "Chapter 10 Multi-format Video Encoder and Decoder" (Page 463)
of RK3568 TRM Part2.

https://dl.radxa.com/rock3/docs/hw/datasheet/Rockchip%20RK3568%20TRM%20Part=
2%20V1.1-20210301.pdf

We also find some mentionioning of JPEG encoding in the RK3399
datasheet.

RK3399:
-------

Look into "Chapter 5 Multi-format Video Decoder And Encoder" (Page 297)
of RK3399 TRM Part 3.

http://www.netbsd.org/~mrg/rk3399/Rockchip%20RK3399TRM%20V1.1%20Part3%20201=
60728.pdf

* Supports encoding of the following standards:
  * H.264: up to HP level 4.1
  * JPEG: Baseline (DCT sequential)

Which probably refers to the core that is also available on the RK3399.


Comparing the register layout of VEPU121 of the RK3568 with the
encoder part in RK3399 we find nearly the same register description.

10.5.21 VEPU121 Detail Registers Description (Page 704 of RK3568 TRM Part2)

vs.

5.5.4 VEPU Registers Summary (Page 443 of RK3399 TRM Part3)

However this is just the documentation, this could mean nothing to
the real world. Getting the core tested with the bootlin stack
or getting feedback from Kever would probably tell the whole story.

The corresponding decoder world on the RK3568 is also very unclear.

It supports RKVDEC (referd as VDPU346 in the TRM), that is probably also
supported by the mainline code you can find in drivers/staging/media/rkvdec=
/.

Then there is VDPU121 which seems to be just the same G1 as in RK3399,
regarding to these patches:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220213195316.4149106-3-piotr.oniszczuk@gmail.=
com/T/

The last Core you probably refer to is called VDPU720 JPEG Decoder
located at 0xFDED0000. I also really don't know where to put this in
at the moment.

>I'll also CC Kever Yang from rockchip, maybe he can shine some light on
>this.

Since the RK3568 seems to get more and more of attention at the moment
I would like to ask if somebody is planning to write support the RKVENC
in mainline. That is the VEPU540 core refered to in the RK3568 TRM.

I would start with that in the next weeks, taking the bootlin H1 support
as an reference to handle the request_api for the encoder part. Which is
currently completely untouched in mainline AFAIK.

Regards,
Michael
