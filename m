Yes, that's what I meant.

There's a long overdue simplification of Kconfig symbols in the
subsystem. Another option would be to compile both in a single module,
as they're often used together. I'll let Sakari chime in, I don't have a
strong preference.

If the privacy LED starts being used for other purposes, users may get
used to seeing it on at random times, which defeats the point of the
privacy LED in the first place.

I suppose the small race condition wouldn't be a big issue, but if we
decide that the privacy LED should really not be used for user purposes,
then I'd still rather disable userspace access when registering the LED.
