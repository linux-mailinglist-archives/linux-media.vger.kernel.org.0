Hello,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I am writing this 
letter to ask for assistance towards my tuition fees. 
Unfortunately I have lost my job thorough redundancy, the income 
from my job was needed to sustain my studies and pay my tuition 
fees. I did not take out a student loan as I did not want to get 
myself into debt, as it is too late to apply I was hoping you 
would be able to provide some sort of assistance towards my 
studies. I have contacted all my immediate family members and 
friends and all the relevant government bodies for grant but have 
been unsuccessful so far.

I am determined to finish my studies and would be grateful for 
any assistance you can provide.You can reach me via 
richard@free2312.com

Please Help

Thank You,

Richard
