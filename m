The commit I'm pointing to in the Fixes tag [1] says "Now that all the DT
drivers have switched to platform_get_irq() we can now safely drop the static
setup of IRQ resource from DT core code.", and while there were patches by the
author [2] to do the required changes on some drivers beforehand, some were
missed, including the mtk-vcodec-enc driver which I fix here. I see at least one
other driver that was missed [3], and it also used the same Fixes tag.

I know that my change isn't meant to be part of the commit in the Fixes, but I
still think it makes the most sense to keep this tag, since its meaning is that
that commit broke the support for this driver and this commit fixes it. Wherever
that commit is applied, this one should too to make sure the mtk-vcodec driver
keeps working.

Thanks,
Nícolas
