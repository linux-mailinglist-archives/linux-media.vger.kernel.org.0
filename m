I agree. V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC should be fine for isoc-based devices as
it should be "close enough" to the start of frame. For bulk it woul dbe
too much of a lie, so I would not emit it for bulk-based devices.

Assuming the device firmware isn't too buggy, the UVC timestamps should
indeed provide much better accuracy than when V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC
could give. I think the biggest problem will be to figure out if a
particular device can be trusted.
