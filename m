Thank you for arranging all this, and thank you to Cisco and Collabora
for the sponsorship.

I will be at Plumbers and Kernel Summit from Tuesday to Thursday, but
may be able to escape on Tuesday to join specific discussions if needed.
I should also be available on Friday, if anyone manages not to catch
covid at the ELCE/OSSE party on Tuesday evening :-)

It will be a busy week.

Most topics could probably use four times as much as what has been
allocated. That's due to no fault in the agenda, it's just the way
things are.

Yes, please. Given the very tight schedule, there will be close to no
time to make presentations. We need to focus on discussions, with
everybody reading the presentation material beforehand. This means
sending presentations ideally at least a week before the workshop. As
far as I'm concerned, an e-mail is good enough, there's no need for
slides unless the topic at hand would really benefit from more graphical
support material.

For anyone opting to present the topic by e-mail, you can reply to this
mail thread, but please change the subject line, for instance to

Subject: [Workshop 2022] V4L2 streams series

> Draft Agenda V1:

Is there a way we can open the room 15 minutes earlier for everybody to
get settled, and start the introduction at 9:00 sharp ?

I expect this topic alone could take the whole day. Ricardo made a
presentation at Kernel Recipes a few months ago, that's good
introductory material (the video has bad quality audio though).
Ricardo, instead of repeating the same presentation, could you focus on
the issues we need to solve to move forward, perhaps with a proposed
plan ?

I would have proposed having lunch in the room to avoid losing one hour,
but that won't be compatible with the conference's mask mandate. I
suppose an hour of brain rest would be welcome anyway :-)

Dave, it would be very useful if you could summarize, based on your
experience, how that information is reported by sensors (I2C reads,
embedded data, ..., but also single value, multiple values, ...) and
what use cases are expected to consume it.

If everybody answers "yes" to this question in reply to this e-mail,
I'll send patches and we can free 15 minutes of discussion time :-)

Do we have t leave the room at 17:00 or would it still be available
should anyone want to continue discussions ?
