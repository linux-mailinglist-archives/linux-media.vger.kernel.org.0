This is a bit of a misnomer IMO, because it is not just about devices that are completely off.
From the ACPI perspective that is about all devices not in D0, which may mean gated clocks
etc.

I would call it probe_low_power or similar and analogously in patch [2/5], and apart from this
I have no objections against this series, but I would suggest to CC the next iteration of it
to Greg K-H and the LKML as it touches the driver core.
