Hi, thank you for trying this out. The versions I see on the Beaglv are 511 for the
decoder and 521c for the encoder.
This driver is also based on a vendor driver from cnm: https://gitlab.collabora.com/chipsnmedia/wave5-driver
Also, a patch to add the firmware was also sent to linux-firmware ml https://lore.kernel.org/linux-firmware/20211126093014.1385752-1-nas.chung@chipsnmedia.com/T/

Thanks,
Dafna
