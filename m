The reason why that isn't really viable is that the "iommus" property 
needs to be consumed directly by the relevant IOMMU driver(s) without a 
dependency on any driver for the client device represented by the node 
itself. For security/isolation purposes the IOMMU has to know about all 
potential DMA sources and be able to be configured for them *before* 
anyone else gets a chance to start initiating DMA from them. If the DT 
consumer is, say, a bare-metal hypervisor, it may have no understanding 
whatsoever of what most of the client devices are nor how they work.

This is part of the reason why we went for a separate "iommu-map" 
property for buses, so that an IOMMU consumer *can* easily tell when 
multiple specifiers do not represent an indivisible set tied to the 
given device, and thus it can expect help from a bus driver to subdivide 
them later (but in the meantime can still safely isolate the entire bus 
based on the output of the map without having to understand the inputs.)

Now, I suppose in some cases it might be technically possible for a 
client device driver to collude with an IOMMU driver to divide a 
monolithic DT device into logical functions after the fact, but for 
Linux I don't see an acceptable way of doing that without some major 
changes to the driver model abstraction and IOMMU API...

Thanks,
Robin.
