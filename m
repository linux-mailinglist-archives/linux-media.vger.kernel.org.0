That's a worthy clarification: I blame neither you nor Sakari, quite the
contrary. As far as I can tell, both of you have done and are doing your
best to fix this kind of issues. Sakari has helped standardizing DisCo
for Imaging for instance, which was the best outcome we could
realistically hope for in this context. Intel is a large company, and as
with any large company, some people end up having to try and fix the
mess created by others :-S I'm sorry it's falling on you and Sakari.

I think you would need to get the Windows and Linux side of the Intel
team(s) responsible for camera drivers and ACPI integration, along with
a manager who can understand the problem, the bad PR, and get the
stakeholders to cooperate and do better in the future. I don't know who
that would be though, what I know is that it doesn't seem the issue will
solve itself without someone with decision power decides to fix it.
