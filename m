Getting happier :-)  I have at least a work-around for each of my two
points of contention.

For #1.  Having ruled out IRQ as an area of interest, looked at PCI
enumeration.  After some reading, on a bit of a whim, I changed device
\_SB.PCI0.CR00._ADR from Zero to One in my custom DSDT.  Now the
driver shows up without having to use pci=noacpi.  In fact, I tested
addresses from 0x01 to 0x0F, and all produced driver loading results.
So I can make this work with a custom DSDT, however I don't know if
this is the correct/accurate fix, or did 2 ugly bugs just have a
beautiful child?  I'd like to know and understand the true solution,
plus I'd like to at least try to feed some sort of realistic
information to ASUS to perhaps make its way into a future BIOS
revision.  Should I start a new thread on linux-acpi with this more
pointed question?

For #2.  This seems to be mostly the common Linux gotcha of
permissions.  Once I added the user to the groups 'input' and 'video'
I started to see results.  Plus the barebones kernel I had made (to
save compile time and have a huge log buffer) was missing most of the
protocols.  Once I added the user to the groups, rebooted with the
full kernel sporting a custom DSDT, ir-keytable and ir-ctl both had
lots to say.

Thanks again.
