Yes, rate control is entirely on userspace.

Modern codec specs (not just vp8) only mandate what constitutes a valid
bitstream and how do decode it. No word about encoding, which means that
actually many different strategies can be applied to produce a valid
bitstream. As such, these strategies look a lot like policies which do not
belong to the kernel and I'd rather provide a tool than a policy.

As far as I know the rate control mechanism used in the gst element is
nothing sophisticated, not even a (full) PID algorithm. Which, I think,
was exactly intended to get the thing running in the first place. I would
assume that the expected algorithm would be PID proper in this case.
Specifically, PID being PID will not prevent the encoding stack from
overrunning the set bandwidth for short periods of time, but exactly
because rate control belongs to userspace anyone is welcome to develop
a solution which provides hard bandwidth guarantees.

Thank you for reporting. In the (expected) case this turns into a
patchset proper I would kindly ask for your Tested-by then.

Can you share what you used for the nightly tests, both in terms of
testing harness and unencoded video material?

Regards,

Andrzej
