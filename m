I'm not sure we should. We still have arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/ for
instance. We can answer that question later though, when confronted with
the situation.

Most of the pain we'll go through in the immediate future comes from the
fact that we never really cared about this. I think renames (of vendors
or product lines) will be infrequent enough that picking sunxi for
Allwinner drivers wouldn't be an issue.

There's a similar think with Renesas, which had an SH product line and
then moved to ARM, creating R-Mobile and R-Car (among other product
liens). That's why we still have drivers/dma/sh/ for Renesas DMA
drivers.

Maybe we can let the Allwinner upstream community tell us what name to
pick ? I'm sure they know better than us :-)
