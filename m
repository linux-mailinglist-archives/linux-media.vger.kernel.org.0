1. We considered enhancing the venus driver to support iris functionality but
concluded that the result would essentially be two parallel drivers implemented
in the same folder.
2. Although the underlying hardware for venus and iris are quite similar, but
there are other factors which brings the need of new driver:
   a. the host firmware interface (HFI) changed between the two. Venus supports
HFI protocol 1.0 while iris supports HFI protocol 2.0.
   b. unlike HFI protocol 1.0, HFI protocol 2.0 is better aligned to V4L2 APIs.
   c. iris driver modularize platforms, hardware variants, and states to extend
it for any upcoming SOC. Thereby more extendable to newer SOCs in future.
   d. Iris also supports many advanced features.
3. Based on the comments received on posted iris driver [1], we evaluated it
further and to better align with the upstream standard and practices, we
acknowledge that even though iris driver is the way forward, it would be ideal
to bring in the Venus hardwares enabled in this driver.
4. Hence, we decided to rework iris driver to add support of HFI protocol 1.0 as
well.
5. Initially we would start with adding support for one HFI protocol 1.0 based
platform which would be SM8250.
6. SM8250 enablement on iris driver would be incremental, starting with basic
decode for H264 codec.
7. In long-term, all venus supported platforms would be migrated to iris.
8. Iris driver and venus driver will co-exist till remaining supported targets
also gets migrated to iris driver.
9. We would continue to support and maintain venus driver during this phased out
approach.

Please share your thoughts on the above proposal.
