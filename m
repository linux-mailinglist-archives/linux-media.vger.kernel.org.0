I have run a bunch of tests on the 5.1 kernel.  I am able to get the
firmware to load now and the hci0 goes up.  I was able to establish a
BLE connection to a TI Sensor Tag and read and write data to it with
good success on the wl1283.

Unfortunately, when I tried to do some more extensive testing over
classic Bluetooth, I got an error that repeats itself at seemingly
random intervals:
      Bluetooth: hci0: Frame reassembly failed (-84)

I can still scan and pair, but these Frame reassembly failed errors
appear to come and go.

Do we need to do anything to enable hardware handshaking?  In the
older st-kim driver, the pdata structure listed flow_cntrl=1.  The
i.MX boards use "uart-has-rtscts" in their device trees, but I don't
see anything like that for the omap3-uart driver.  I am not all that
familiar with the Bluetooth subsystem, so I am not sure what would
cause the Frame reassembly error.
