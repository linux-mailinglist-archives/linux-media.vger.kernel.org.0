I think the root cause is something else.

Let me say first of all that swapping the order of the two calls does make sense:
before returning the buffer you want to mark the queue as stopped.

But the real problem is that for drivers using the mem2mem framework the streaming
ioctls can be serialized with a different lock than the VIDIOC_DE/ENCODER_CMD ioctls.

The reason for that is that those two ioctls are not marked with INFO_FL_QUEUE,
but I think they should. These ioctls are really part of the streaming ioctls
and should all use the same lock.

Note that for many drivers the same mutex is used for the streaming ioctls as for
all other ioctls, but it looks like at least the venus driver uses separate mutexes.

With that change in v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c I don't believe any locking is needed,
since it should always be serialized by the same top-level mutex.

The v4l2_ioctl_get_lock() function in v4l2-ioctl.c is the one that selects which
mutex to use for a given ioctl.
