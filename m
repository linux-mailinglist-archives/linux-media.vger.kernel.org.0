I'm not seeing what you're talking about.

The only thing I see in this thread is that we don't want to call
pm_runtime_mark_last_busy(dev) which updates the last_busy time that is
used for autosuspend.

The other thing that was discussed was pm_runtime_put_noidle() vs
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend().  "The pm_runtime_put_noidle() should have
the same effect as yours variant".  So apparently they are equivalent
in this situation.  How should we choose one vs the other?

I'm not trying to be obtuse.  I understand that probably if I worked in
PM then I wouldn't need documentation...  :/
