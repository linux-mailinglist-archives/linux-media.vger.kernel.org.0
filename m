We have to be careful here. Part of the job of the ACPI methods for
camera objects is to control the camera sensor PMIC and set up the right
voltages (many PMICs have programmable output levels). In many cases
we've seen with the IPU3, broken ACPI support means the methods will try
to do something completely bogus, like accessing a PMIC at an incorrect
I2C address. That's mostly fine, it will result in the camera not being
detected. We could however have broken ACPI implementation that would
program the PMIC to output voltages that would damage the sensor. Users
won't be happy.

And now that I wrote that, maybe that's what we should hope for, a major
recall of machines from Dell or Lenovo, whose financial cost would give
an incentive to fixing this mess in the future... *sigh*
