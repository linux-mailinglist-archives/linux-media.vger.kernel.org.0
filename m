That would only cover the active state, not the try state.

I made a test change by changing the subdev state to have 'struct mutex 
_lock' and 'struct mutex *lock', similar to the struct 
v4l2_ctrl_handler. The driver could then, in its init_cfg(), set the 
state->lock to either v4l2_ctrl_handler.lock or a lock in the driver's 
private data.

This kind of lock sharing makes me a bit uncomfortable (although the 
controls are already allowing this, and a driver private mutex can be 
set as the ctrl lock): if I call v4l2_subdev_lock_active_state(), I 
don't expect the controls to be locked too.

Then again, if I think about this as the subdev state really containing 
three parts: 1) the subdev active & try states, 2) controls, 3) driver 
private data, then it kind of makes sense. In the long run we could move 
towards combining these pieces together, and thus cleaning up the state 
management and locking.
