Aren't most reserved-memory bindings just software policy if you look at 
it that way, though? IIUC this is a pool of memory that is visible and 
available to the Non-Secure OS, but is fundamentally owned by the Secure 
TEE, and pages that the TEE allocates from it will become physically 
inaccessible to the OS. Thus the platform does impose constraints on how 
the Non-Secure OS may use it, and per the rest of the reserved-memory 
bindings, describing it as a "reusable" reservation seems entirely 
appropriate. If anything that's *more* platform-related and so 
DT-relevant than typical arbitrary reservations which just represent 
"save some memory to dedicate to a particular driver" and don't actually 
bear any relationship to firmware or hardware at all.

However, the fact that Linux's implementation of how to reuse reserved 
memory areas is called CMA is indeed still irrelevant and has no place 
in the binding itself.

Thanks,
Robin.
