Yeah. And I missed that v4l2 added dma-buf export too.

Again, the issue here is _only_ with follow_pfn. For videobuf1 this
means videbuf-dma-contig.c userptr support is broken. Unlike videobuf2
it means it's broken for all usage (not just zero-copy userptr),
because videbuf-dma-contig.c lacks the pin_user_pages path. But that
would be easy to add if this poses a  problem I think - we just need
to carry over the pin_user_pages_fast logic from videbuf2, no driver
changes required. But of course I don't think we should do that before
someone reports the regression, since videobuf1 userptr is doubly
deprecated :-)

Everything else keeps working with videobuf1 with my patch series. So
depending upon which videobuf1 implementations these 8 drivers use,
you might not even have any real breakage there.

I'm not breaking the world with this, it's really very minimal
use-case. At least as far as I'm understanding the entire media
subsystem here.
