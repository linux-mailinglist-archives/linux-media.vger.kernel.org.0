What exactly does it mean to "submit this cmd buffer to ADLA hardware" ?

Does your h/w provides queues for the user/driver to put their
workloads/cmd-bufs on them ? And does it provide some completion queue
to notify when the work is completed?

Or do you handle one cmd at a time, where the user sends a cmd buffer
to the driver and the driver then submit it by writing to a couple of
registers and polls on some status register until its done, or waits
for an interrupt to mark it as done ?

This probably depends on the answer to my question above. btw, there
are drivers in drm that handle IPs that are part of an SOC, so
platform_driver is supported.
