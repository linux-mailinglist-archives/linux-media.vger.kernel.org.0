Hmm, coda_start_decoding as called from .start_streaming is indeed just
serialized by the device coda_mutex.Â I would prefer this to be scheduled
as a work item as well though, those are way easier to reason about.

As an aside, while SEQ_INIT on its own is fast, technically
.start_streaming (or .buf_queue, see below) wouldn't even have to wait
until the SEQ_INIT command has finished, in case the BIT processor is
busy decoding for another context.

I suppose it should try SEQ_INIT on every OUTPUT .buf_queue as long as
initialization hasn't succeeded, not only on .start_streaming of the
second queue (whichever is last). Right now, the buffers fed into the
output queue before STREAMON on both OUTPUT and CAPTURE must already
contain headers, or stream start will fail.

While I'm not sure if any odd corner cases could still arise with this
change, I think you are right. I remember having a few deadlock issues
with the locking before adding the workqueue, but that was before we
could just wait for the device to finish in .device_run.

I agree with both analysis and conclusion.

Yes, that is a good idea.
