I'll reply here to this question that is asked in a few other places.

I can only point you to the ov5640 driver, which is capable of both
YUV/RGB and RAW as this sensor is. The ov5640 driver supports both the
g/s/enum_frame_interval and has writable blankings. I guess it's more
for historical reasons, as when blankings have been made writable
users of the frame_interval API would have been displeased if that
interface went away.

The resulting implementation is not nice, as changing vblank doesn't
update the framerate reported through g_frame_interval, and keeping
the two in sync is not trivial.

I would suggest to go for writable blankings, and if you already plan
to remove frame_interval then not add it in first place so there won't
be displeased users.

Sakari, Laurent, what's your opinion here ?

Let's wait for GC to get back with more information then, it still
feels weird that a CSI-2 compliant sensor sends data out in a way
different from what is described in the spec..

See the above question
