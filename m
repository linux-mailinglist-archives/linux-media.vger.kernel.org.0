It's the DC30 variant without an adv7175.

Before I do that, I would really like to know a bit more about this issue:
can you reproduce it? Is it DC30 specific or a general problem with zoran?

The problem with this hard hang is that it is hard to do regression testing
with v4l2-compliance, since it will hang as soon as MJPG pixelformat is
tested.

I would feel much happier if the hang can be avoided, even if it is just
with a temporary hack. It will make it much easier going forward.

Regards,

	Hans
