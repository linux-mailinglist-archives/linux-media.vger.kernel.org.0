That is long-term, however, and in the meantime something needs to be
done about it too.

Sakari is telling me that the warning on boot triggered by firmware
issues was in a new driver and it has been addressed in 6.10-rc3
already.

This is good, as we don't need to worry about people reporting a
regression because of it any more.

Still, IIUC, the driver simply fails to probe if it doesn't get
correct information from the platform firmware and a quirk needs to be
added to the ACPI enumeration code for the driver to use a different
source of information.

I'm wondering if the driver could be modified to switch over to the
different source of information automatically if the firmware-provided
data don't make any sense to it, after logging an FW_BUG message.  It
could even use the other source of information to sanity-check the
firmware-provided data in principle.  It's all software, so it should
be doable.

Seriously though, we could create a Linux-based utility that would
retrieve all of the relevant information from the firmware using the
existing kernel code and they say "this is what I would do to the
hardware based on this information".  That could help people to do
basic checks if they cared.
