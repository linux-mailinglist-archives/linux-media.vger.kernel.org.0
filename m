Is that so for the display side too, or only for the video decoder ?

I don't think that's a problem as such, as long as both the V4L2 and DRM
formats make sense on their own.

Agreed, we need modifiers support in V4L2. This has been discussed
previously ([1]), and a proposal ([2]) has been submitted two years ago,
it needs to be revived.
