Exactly. While most people don't use it this way, the kernel and DT are
supposed to be independent, e.g. the DTB could be included in the
device firmware, while the kernel could be updated via a distro.

To not break this use-case without a good reason, new kernels should
try to not regress functionality with a existing binary DT. We can
mandate DT updates for new functionality (like being able to use the G2
core only with the new blk-ctrl + split VPU binding), but we shouldn't
break existing features if there isn't a very good reason to do so.
Keeping the bit of code in the VPU driver to keep the old G1 only
decoding working with a new kernel isn't much of a burden IMHO, so we
should try to keep it alive.

Lucas
