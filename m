v4l2-loopback is a bit like, or the difference to this at least, is that
it does not really have any life-cycle model or constraints what it is.

And in terms of "if this was  in terms of dual-VB2 pipeline and on
producer side locking into DMA-BUF is how you would want to approach the
topic.

I will phase down attention to the topic a bit. It's been noted. I'm not
sending a new version at least any time soon.

I will look into this topic.

With a quick ACM search mocking /dev/videoX is not alien approach. And
when it is done it's not focused-on-V4L2 type of situation but more like
being able to drive a software platform without associated hardware. And
when doing something like this with QEMU, it is really nice to still
have uncluttered and stackless-as-possible data paths,

[and I at lest would not try to run 'qemu' through camerify from
libcamera-tools]

You can project from that at least that there are other applications too
for "software-defined camera", and what people do in academic world has
reflection to R&D in industry (e.g. drone industry). It's an asset to
use software as far as possible even when doing embedded platforms.

Thanks for the pointers anyhow. This was very informative. These are
great lore references too.
