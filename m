I think I've explained before how this should be fixed at the V4L2
level. The problem actually affects character devices globally, and Greg
KH said he would have a go at fixing it there, but I don't think much
happened. Starting with a V4L2-level fix is fine with me.

There are a few patches in the series that are specific to uvcvideo,
I'll have another look and merge those.
