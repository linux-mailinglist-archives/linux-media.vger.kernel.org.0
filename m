Subject: [PATCH] dt-bindings: power: Fix path to power-domain.txt bindings
Date:   Tue, 19 Nov 2019 22:43:15 +0800
Message-Id: <20191119144315.11261-1-krzk@kernel.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.17.1
Sender: linux-media-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-media@vger.kernel.org

With split of power domain controller bindings to power-domain.yaml, the
consumer part was renamed to power-domain.txt.  Update the references in
other bindings.

Reported-by: Geert Uytterhoeven <geert@linux-m68k.org>
Fixes: abb4805e343a ("dt-bindings: power: Convert Samsung Exynos Power Domain bindings to json-schema")
Signed-off-by: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzk@kernel.org>
