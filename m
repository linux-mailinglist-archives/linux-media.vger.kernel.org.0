That would be for combined RGB mode, as every pixel is accounted for
three times in that mode. In other modes, a step size of 8 should be
fine.

The documentation states that the width of the bin counter registers is
20 bits wide including a 4-bit fractional part, and that the software
should use only the upper 16 bits of the bin counters. The fractional
part is caused by the weights. There's a corresponding todo comment in
libcamera:

	...
	 *
         * \todo Take into account weights. That is, if the weights are low
         * enough we can potentially reduce the predivider to increase
         * precision. This needs some investigation however, as this hardware
         * behavior is undocumented and is only an educated guess.
         */
        int count = mode == RKISP1_CIF_ISP_HISTOGRAM_MODE_RGB_COMBINED ? 3 : 1;
        double factor = size.width * size.height * count / 65536.0;
        double root = std::sqrt(factor);
        uint8_t predivider = static_cast<uint8_t>(std::ceil(root));

        return std::clamp<uint8_t>(predivider, 3, 127);

libcamera sets the default weights to 1, and discards the 4 fractional
bits. It seems that the 

I expect that each pixel contributes to its bin by adding the weight
value corresponding to its zone. Setting all weights to 1, I would
expect that the 4 fractional bits could be used to increase the bin size
to 1048575 pixels (20 bits), and therefore decrease the predivider from
10 to 3.

The documented constraint is

    hist_h_offset + hist_h_size x 5 should be less than or equal to the
    horizontal size of the picture.

(and similar for the vertical direction). The initial -1 seems to be a
bug.
