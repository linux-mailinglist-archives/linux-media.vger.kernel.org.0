I'm quite surprised that the G2 codec should have such a much lower max
frequency compared with the G1. While the table from the RM hasn't been
obviously incorrect for any other clock, I'm still inclined to believe
the frequencies stated in the datasheet.

Yea, not sure how to proceed here. 300MHz is the safe bet, but we are
leaving quite some performance on the table if the datasheet is
correct. Without some help from NXP it's probably hard to validate 
which max frequency statement is correct. It doesn't really help that
the NXP downstream kernel seems to drive the G2 at 600MHz, which is
neither the 550MHz nominal mode max, nor the 660MHz overdrive mode max.

Lucas
