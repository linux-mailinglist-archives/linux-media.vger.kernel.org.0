Yes. That said, since this is fairly specific and doesn't fall into any of
the three discussions that we plan (codecs, libcamera, future developments)
I think it is more useful if I discuss this separately with Angelo and
Joao on Monday or Tuesday afternoon.

I can definitely discuss HDMI support, and probably give a good stab at the
CSI support (too bad Sakari won't be there).

How about we get together after Greg KH's keynote on Monday?

Regards,
