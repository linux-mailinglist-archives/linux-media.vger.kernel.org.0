Yes. vimc_device is the master device for all the component drivers and
it being released early definitely causes problems. I tried to solve
this by isolating the media_device embedded in it and taking that out
of contention for release later. This problem could be solved by making
sure vimc_device sticks around and I am on that solution now.

Yes. You will find such problems with various media drivers. It could be
the v4l2 device or some other device that gets released while still in
use.

Drivers still need to handle such issues anyway. Is there a reason why
you think it is a work-around?

Labeling this hack doesn't accurate. I agree though that this might be a
big hammer and there might be other solutions that can be limited to
just vimc scope. :)

During the reviews, it was deemed necessary to make media driver as the
master for creating parts of the tree and provide hooks for other
drivers to add their own media components to the tree. The same is
extended to other interfaces. This feature was on ice for so long,
I don't recall all the details on how it evolved.
