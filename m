What I mean is, that the MT9M131 sensor gets enabled and immediately
start sending frames before I told him to do so e.g. by calling
s_stream(). This can confuse the downstream device. The only way to get
enable the downstream device first is to add the s_power() callback.

But then you're introducing new drivers with s_power() callbacks and so
the behaviour isn't really changed.

Right but the s_power() behaviour is not changed and drivers still rely
on it to work as right now.
