I am also not familiar with V4L2.  So I try not to touch too many things in
V4L2.

The current asrc memory to memory is implemented based on the alsa
asrc driver,  that asrc alsa driver needs 'rate' parameter.

The struct v4l2_vbi_format has a value: sampling_rate,  is there any reason
here?

if use controls,  do I need to define a new one?
