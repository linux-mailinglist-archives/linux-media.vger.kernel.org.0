No, we don't need to put platform data into the kernel for every bit
of information that can be retrieved from the platform firmware via
ACPI.

The vast majority of information in the ACPI tables is actually
correct and if quirks are needed, they usually are limited in scope.

Where it breaks is when the ACPI tables are not sufficiently validated
by OEMs which mostly happens when the data in question are not needed
to pass some sort of certification or admission tests.

Which unfortunately is related to whether or not Windows uses those data.

Well, what do you mean by "break".  I thought that platform data
needed to support them were built into the kernel, weren't they?

No, it is not desirable, but the way to address it is to convince the
Windows people to stop doing this and use standard-defined data from
the ACPI tables instead.  It cannot be addressed by Linux unilaterally
trying to do the right thing, because there are OEMs who don't care
about Linux.
