Hi Ville,

Thanks for your review !

My understanding was that CTA-861 mandates that 640x480@60Hz is
supported, and mentions it being the default timing on a few occurences,
like in section 4 - Video Formats and Waveform Timings that states "This
section describes the default IT 640x480 Video Timing as well as all of
the standard CE Video Timings.", or Section 6.2 - Describing Video
Formats in EDID "The 640x480@60Hz flag, in the Established Timings area,
shall always be set, since the 640x480p format is a mandatory default
timing."

So my understanding is that default here applies to the timing itself,
and not the bpc, and is thus the second interpretation you suggested.

I'll add a comment to make it clearer.

Yeah, indeed. I guess it's a judgement call on whether we prioritise
lowering the bpc over selecting YUV422, but I guess I can try all
available RGB bpc before falling back to YUV422.

I guess if the priority is given to lowering bpc, then it indeed doesn't
make sense to support YUV422, since the limiting factor is likely to be
the TMDS char rate and YUV422 12 bpc is equivalent to RGB 8bpc there.

dw-hdmi on the other hand will always put YUV422 and YUV444 before RGB
for a given bpc, which is weird to me:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/synop=
sys/dw-hdmi.c#L2696

What is even weirder to me is that YUV422 is explicitly stated to be
12bpc only, so there's some invalid configurations there (8 and 10 bpc).

And given that it's order by decreasing order of preference, I'm pretty
sure it'll never actually pick any YUV or RGB > 8bpc format since RGB
8bpc is super likely to be always available and thus picked first.

If we want to converge, I think we should amend this code to support
YUV420 for YUV420-only modes first, and then the RGB options like i915
is doing. And then if someone is interested in more, we can always
expand it to other formats.

It's another discussion we had in an earlier version, but yeah we lack
the infrastructure to support those for now. I still believe it would
require an increased max_bpc to select YUV422, otherwise things would be
pretty inconsistent with other YUV formats.

But yeah, we need to provide a hook to report we don't support RGB >
8bpc for HDMI 1.4 devices. Which goes back to the previous question
actually, I believe it would still provide value to support YUV422 on
those devices, with something like:

for (bpc =3D max_bpc; bpc >=3D 8; bpc -=3D 2) {
    if (!connector->hdmi->funcs->validate_config(mode, RGB, bpc))
       continue;

    // Select RGB with bpc
    ...
}

if (connector->hdmi->funcs->validate_config(mode, YUV) &&
    hdmi_try_format_bpc(..., mode, 12, YUV422) {
   // Select YUV422, 12 bpc
   ...
}

What do you think?
