And applications *must not* touch the controls behind libcamera's back.

This being said, the V4L2 API allows multiple opens, so the atomisp2
driver needs to implement that to pass v4l2-compliance. It just
shouldn't be used.

Why so ? Who uses that custom ioctl with mainline ? We should expose
sensor controls on the sensor subdev and drop redundant custom APIs.
It's not just about libcamera, nobody expects custom ioctls to set
sensor controls.

libcamera requires an MC device to enumerate cameras (the Raspberry Pi
drivers have supported this from their very first day in libcamera), so
you need at least that. The pipeline doesn't strictly need to be
controlled through MC, but I see no reason to use legacy APIs here.

It has custom sensor drivers which need to be split out and moved to
drivers/media/i2c/ (or replaced with drivers already present in that
directory).

It should be trivial. I'd take it one step further and register entities
for the sensor and ISP. This should be trivial too, and will allow
locating the sensor subdev device node easily.

Moving sensor control from a video node to a subdev node should be easy.
I'd start doing so already, you'll then be able to use the libcamera
CameraSensor class in the pipeline handler.

The harder part with MC is to control the full pipeline, but we don't
need to do so, we can have a monolothic entity for the ISP in the media
graph, and use custom ioctls to control it.

This needs to be investigated to figure out what it corresponds to. It
could indeed be that the hardware has two pipelines that can be operated
in parallel, one for each sensor. Or it could be that the driver
registers different video nodes for the two sensors, but make them
mutually exclusive, in which case half of the video nodes need to be
dropped. The only thing I've been told is that the atomisp2 is an inline
ISP.
