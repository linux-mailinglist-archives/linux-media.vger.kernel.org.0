Overall the reset and reboot method is pretty ugly in my opinion. But to st=
ick
with the pure rationale, rebooting the SCP on MTK is much harder, since its=
 not
specific to a single HW/driver.

Other codecs like Samsung MFC, Venus/Iris, Chips&Media, etc. that approach =
seams
plausible, but we still can't trust the buffer, which to me is not acceptab=
le.
