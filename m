That didn't answer my question :-)

Why do you need to expose this? Who uses it for what purpose?

Correct.

The problem is that for sensors it is indeed not clear.

In principle the crop bounds matches the resolution that the sensor uses
pre-scaling. So yes, that means that it is equal to the native size.

But many sensors have a discrete list of supported formats and it is not
clear how they map each format to the actual sensor. If it is clearly just
done through binning or averaging, then all is fine.

If the formats have different aspect ratios, then it becomes a bit more
difficult how to relate the crop bounds with the format since you may not
know to which sensor area the current format corresponds.

I have no clear answer for you, to be honest, but it can get tricky.

It depends on my original question: what do you need this information for?
