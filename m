If you have a benchmarking setup available it would be very interesting 
for future reference to see how changing from WD to WW mutexes affects 
the roll back frequency. WW is known to cause rollbacks much less 
frequently but there is more work associated with each rollback.

Hmm. Sounds like we need a per-manager ww_rwsem protecting manager 
allocation, taken in write-mode then there's thrashing. In read-mode 
otherwise. That would limit the amount of "unnecessary" locks we'd have 
to keep and reduce unwanted side-effects, (see below):

Yes, I see the problem.

But my first reaction is that this might have undersirable side-effects. 
Let's say somebody wanted to swap the evicted BOs out? Or cpu-writes to 
them causing faults, that might also block the mm_sem, which in turn 
blocks hugepaged?

Still it's a fairly simple solution to a problem that seems otherwise 
hard to solve efficiently.

Thanks,
Thomas
