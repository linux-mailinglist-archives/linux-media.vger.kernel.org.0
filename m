I've run it with the staging driver on i.MX8MP, not i.MX8MQ. The MQ
seems to have the same CSI bridge, but a different CSI-2 receiver (and
PHY). It would be great if you could contribute a driver for that :-)

I've sent a large patch series recently, if you could review it it would
speed up integration ;-)

I've seen similar (but not identical) issues that were due to incorrect
Ths_settle values in the D-PHY. You could start by trying different
values there. This seems to be controlled on i.MX8MQ by
CSI2_1_S_PRG_RXHS_SETTLE in IOMUXC_GPR_GPR34 or CSI2_2_S_PRG_RXHS_SETTLE
in IOMUXC_GPR_GPR41, but the value of the fields are not properly
documented :-S The i.MX8MM suffered from the same issue, but a table
with register values for different clock frequencies was posted by NXP
on their support forum. Maybe the same information could be available
there for i.M8XMQ ?
