Seems like it is made on purpose, isn't it :)

Are there that many blank/invalid lines/cols ?

Is my intrpretation of the above correct ?

Math looks right at least:

        2000 - 16 - 24 - 16 = 1944
        2624 - 16 - 16 = 2592

As V4L2 selection targets are defined in respect to they larger
sourrounding target, if the documentation about the full size array
(3296,2480) doesn't tell you what offset the readable part is, I think
it's fair to define
        - NATIVE == BOUNDS = (0, 0, 2624, 2000)
        - DEFAULT == CROP = (16, 16, 2592, 1944)

Or maybe better not define NATIVE at all.

The skipped rows/cols almost seems to match what the datasheet suggests by
combining the cropping and windowing rectangles top/left offsets (with
2 cols more skipped compared to my understanding)

        crop = (0, 12, 2624, 1952)
        win = (16, 6, 2592, 1944)

        CROP = (16, 18, 2592, 1944)

The driver does that a little differently with:

        crop = (0, 4, 2624, 1968)
        win = (16, 13, 2592, 1944)

        CROP = (16, 17, 2624, 1944)

Which seems a little off as the driver values for the VTS and HTS
register counts from 0 hence it seems to be skipping 17 rows and 18
cols (maybe the driver adjusts when writing the values to registers ?)

If you feel like it you can try to adjust the driver rectangles, but
in my experience subtle regressions might be introduced by moving
those values, hence I would not be too concerned and just report
whatever the driver does. I assume you're doing this in the context of
pleasing libcamera requirements, and as much as I don't like saying
this, if we're 1 or 2 columns off when reporting the CROP rectangle,
it's not a huge issue.
