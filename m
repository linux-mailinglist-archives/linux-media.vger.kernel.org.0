The OF folks have shunned to the use of the iterative varants as that can
often lead to complicated parsing of the endpoints. As obtaining the
endpoint based on port and endpoint IDs works well in all cases I've
suggested people to use that. But as the backend, at least currently, uses
iterative functions, they're unlikely to disappear in the future.

If that is the case, then you can't use the bulk API.

That also requires the board to be wired in such a way that these
regulators have no other users.

I think you'll need pm_runtime_idle() call after enabling runtime PM.
