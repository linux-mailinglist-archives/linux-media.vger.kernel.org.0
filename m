In request-api case does the control will return EBUSY immediately when
S_CTRL is called from the client? I'm asking in the context of the
controls which are not dynamic (cannot set during streaming and Reset
sequence is needed).

It seems that clients needs to know SPS/PPS (for muxers?) and thus they
will need to extract or parse the encoder output buffers to find them.
Maybe the spec should consider adding some buffer flag to mark such
buffers which contain SPS/PPS only.

[1] - see at "type AvcCBox struct"

Nicolas, how the gstreamer handle this?
