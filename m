The trouble is, that if you have other memory than stuff allocated by the
dma-api or mapped using the dma-api, then by necessity the exporter has to
deal with this.

Which is the exact same reason we also force the exporters to deal with
the cpu cache flushing - you're argument that it's not great to replicate
this everywhere holds there equally.

The other thing is that right now the exporter is the only one who
actually knows what kind of dma coherency rules apply for a certain piece
of memory. E.g. on i915-gem even if it's dma_map_sg mapped the underlying
i915-gem buffer might be non-coherent, and i915-gem makes it all work by
doing the appropriate amount of clflush.

Similar funky things happen in other cases.

So unless we add an interface which allows importers to figure out how
much flushing is needed, currently the exporter is the only one who knows
(because it can inspect the struct device at dma_buf_attach time).

We could flip this around, but it would be a rather serious depature from
the dma-buf design approach thus far.

Yeah CXL will make this all even more fun, but we are firmly there already
with devices deciding per-buffer (or sometimes even per-access with
intel's MOCS stuff) what coherency mode to use for a buffer.

Also arm soc generally have both coherent and non-coherent device
interconnects, and I think some devices can switch with runtime flags too
which mode they use for a specific transition.

CXL just extends this to pcie devices.

So the mess is here, how do we deal with it?

My take is that the opt-in callback addition is far from great, but it's
in line with how we extended dma-buf the past decade plus too. So unless
someone's volunteering to pour some serious time into re-engineering this
all (including testing all the different device/driver<->device/driver
interactions) I think there's only really one other option: To not support
these cases at all. And I don't really like that, because it means people
will hack together something even worse in their drivers.

By adding it to dma-buf it'll stare us in our faces at least :-/
