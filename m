This series is a split from the series :
[PATCH v9 00/13] media: atmel: atmel-isc: implement media controller
and it includes the media controller part.
previous fixes were sent on a different patch series.

As discussed on the ML, moving forward with having the media link validate at
start/stop streaming call.
I will test the patch :
[RFC PATCHv2] vb2: add support for (un)prepare_streaming queue ops
afterwards, but that patch requires moving my logic to the new vb2 callbacks.

Full series history:

Changes in v10:
-> split the series into this first fixes part.
-> moved IO_MC addition from first patch to the second patch on the driver changes
-> edited commit messages
-> DT nodes now disabled by default.

Changes in v9:
-> kernel robot reported isc_link_validate is not static, changed to static.

Changes in v8:
-> scaler: modified crop bounds to have the exact source size

Changes in v7:
-> scaler: modified crop bounds to have maximum isc size
-> format propagation: did small changes as per Jacopo review


Changes in v6:
-> worked a bit on scaler, added try crop and other changes as per Jacopo review
-> worked on isc-base enum_fmt , reworked as per Jacopo review

Changes in v5:
-> removed patch that removed the 'stop' variable as it was still required
-> added two new trivial patches
-> reworked some parts of the scaler and format propagation after discussions with Jacopo


Changes in v4:
-> as reviewed by Hans, added new patch to remove the 'stop' variable and reworked
one patch that was using it
-> as reviewed by Jacopo, reworked some parts of the media controller implementation


Changes in v3:
- change in bindings, small fixes in csi2dc driver and conversion to mc
for the isc-base.
- removed some MAINTAINERS patches and used patterns in MAINTAINERS

Changes in v2:
- integrated many changes suggested by Jacopo in the review of the v1 series.
- add a few new patches
