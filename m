Allwinner (as a company) isn't directly involved in maintaining upstream Li=
nux=20
support. Drivers are provided by linux-sunxi community, sometimes by cleani=
ng=20
up vendor drivers or more often by writing them from scratch.

That being said, "sunxi" is extensively used in vendor kernel, most often i=
t's=20
directory name containing vendor specific driver. It's derived from SoC fam=
ily=20
name, like sun4i, sun5i, sun5i, sun50i, etc. where number is replaced with =
X.

sunxi is synonym for Allwinner basically from the start. Community build=20
around these SoCs is called linux-sunxi and even entry in MAINTAINERS conta=
ins=20
both names: "ARM/Allwinner sunXi SoC support". Note that sunxi is not limit=
ed=20
to ARM SoCs. RISC-V family is called sun20i.

Hope this helps.
