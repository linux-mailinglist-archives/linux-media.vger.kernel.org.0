I lack a bit of knowledge on how to scale this to different devices, with
different speed/framesize. My only bulk device is:

https://inogeni.com/product/4k2usb3/

Which is USB 3.0, and have raw (NV12) resolution from 640x480 (max 60pfs) t=
o 4K
(max 30fps). What would the error look like with that ?

We have v4l2_event.timestamp for all events, so the jitter to process the e=
vent
by userpace can be removed reliably already.
