Already addressed by
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20220722015211.63609-1-slark_xiao@163.com/

I wonder what's happening... This is the 3rd if not 4th identical
patch I receive for this issue.

Are you sending this patch as part of a new contributors program like
outreachy or similar ? If that's the case I would like to ask mentors
to require contributors to check patchwork/lore before sending a
patch. I'm reading a lot of "thanks but it's already fixed" replies on
the media list these days..
