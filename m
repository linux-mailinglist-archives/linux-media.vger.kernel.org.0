Hello Dearest,

I know this mail will come to you as a surprise since we haven't known or
come across each other before considering the fact that I sourced your
email contact through the Internet in search of a trusted person who can
assist me.

I am Miss Lisa Ibrahim Coulibaly 24 years old female from the Republic of
Ivory Coast, West Africa, am the Daughter of Late Chief Sgt. Warlord
Ibrahim Coulibaly (a.k.a General IB). My late father was a well known Ivory
Coast militia leader. He died on Thursday 28 April 2011 following a fight
with the Republican Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI). I am constrained to
contact you because of the maltreatment which I am receiving from my step
mother, you can read more about my late Father death through the below
links:


https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/28/ivory-coast-renegade-warlord-ibrahim-coulibaly
.


My step Mother planned to take away all my late father's treasury and
properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.
Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hides away my international
passport and other valuable documents. Luckily she did not discover where I
kept my father's File which contained important documents. Now I am
presently staying in the Mission Camp in Burkina Faso.

I am seeking a long term relationship and investment assistance. My father
of blessed memory deposited the sum of US$ 9.5 Million in one bank in
Burkina Faso with my name as the next of kin. I had contacted the Bank to
clear the deposit but the Branch Manager told me that my status according
to the law does not authorize me to carry out the operation. However, he
advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted
to inform my stepmother about this deposit but I am afraid that she will
not offer me anything after the release of the money.

Therefore, I decide to seek your help in transferring the money into your
bank account while I will relocate to your country and settle down with
you. As you indicated your interest to help me I will give you the account
number and the contact of the bank where my late beloved father deposited
the money with my name as the next of kin. It is my intention to compensate
you with 20% of the total money for your assistance and the balance shall
be my investment in any profitable venture which you will recommend to me
as I have no any idea about foreign investment. Please all communications
should be through this email address for confidential purposes.

Please all communications should be through this email address for
confidential purposes. (lisacoulibaly023@gmail.com)

Thanking you a lot in anticipation of your quick response. I will give you
details in my next mail after receiving your acceptance mail to help me,

Yours sincerely
Miss Lisa Ibrahim Coulibaly
