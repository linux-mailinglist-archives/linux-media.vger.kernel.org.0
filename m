While not exactly part of this series, how do you handle UB960 
configuration? I don't remember all the options, but if I'm not 
mistaken, a GPIO can be generated internally (e.g. frame sync you 
mention), but it can also come into UB960 via a pin (could also be used 
for a frame sync). And there were some debug options that can be exposed 
via the GPIOs.

I'm not asking to implement all those, but I think it's worth at least 
going through them, to have an idea if whatever is done now could 
possibly support the other features.

I think option 3 is okay.

Although I (perhaps naively) think that the approach in this patch feels 
nicest: the user just defines the GPIO the normal way in the dts, and 
marks it with a REMOTE flag. But I think the REMOTE flag should be a 
device specific flag. Are those allowed?

But now, after writing the above, I wonder... If we use the REMOTE flag, 
that will be in the consumer side of the GPIO, i.e. in the sensor node. 
A 'ti,remote-sources' (or whatever it would be named) property would be 
in the provider, the serializer node. Which one is the correct place to 
configure a thing like this? The REMOTE flag is not quite like the usual 
flags in gpio.h, as the sensor works fine (wrt. the gpio) with or 
without the REMOTE flag.

So maybe 'ti,remote-sources' in the serializer node is better, after 
all, to configure where the serializer gets the GPIOs value...

As for doing this configuration at runtime, with no DT changes... In 
theory that would be possible with custom V4L2 controls to both the 
serializer and the deserializer. But I don't know how the user could 
ever know how to configure it, without having detailed information about 
the HW.

For example, let's say the board generates a frame sync signal (a pulse, 
30 Hz), which is connected to deserializer's GPIO pin X. The deser needs 
to be configured to take the signal from pin X, and forward it to 
serializers 0,1,2,3. Then the serializer needs to be configured to use 
the "remote" gpio X from the deser, and provide it from the serializer's 
GPIO pin, going to the sensor.
