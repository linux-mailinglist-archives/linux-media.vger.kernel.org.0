I agree with all that, but what's the recommended practice to add
top-level clocks and regulators in overlays, in a way that avoids
namespace clashes with the base board ?

The THP7312 is an external ISP. At the hardware level, it has an input
side, with a CSI-2 receiver and an I2C master controller, and an output
side, with a CSI-2 transmitter and an I2C slave controller. A raw camera
sensor is connected on the input side, transmitting image data to the
THP7312, and being controlled over I2C by the firmware running on the
THP7312. From a Linux point of view, only the output side of the THP7312
is visible, and the combination of the raw camera sensor and the THP7312
acts as a smart camera sensor, producing YUV images.

As there are two CSI-2 buses, the data lanes configuration needs to be
specified for both sides. On the output side, connected to the SoC and
visible to Linux, the bindings use a port node with an endpoint and the
standard data-lanes property. On the input side, which is invisible to
Linux, the bindings use the vendor-specific thine,rx,data-lanes
property. Its semantics is identical to the standard data-lanes
property, but it's not located in an endpoint as there's no port for the
input side.
