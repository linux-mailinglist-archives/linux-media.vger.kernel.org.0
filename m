Just so we don't forget, there is a handful of 10bit tests that Daniel Alme=
ida
omitted when he added tests to fluster (though only 1 is 420). I will try a=
nd
fix that later on. There is otherwise 5G worth of 10bit tests available. In
fluster we decided to go for the same subset libvpx uses, otherwise no one =
would
ever want to download these tests.

https://storage.googleapis.com/downloads.webmproject.org/vp9/decoder-test-s=
treams/Profile_2_10bit.

About the "min supported", G2 VP9 scores is 157/303 here (in comparision rk=
vdec
is 225, and MTK VCODEC 275). At this failure level this has no longer anyth=
ing
to do with the size of the render. There is likely couple of bugs hidden in=
 the
driver for the corner cases tested by the suite. Also, to illustrate that t=
he
size isn't the only variable in the failures, we have a vp90-2-02-size-
64x34.webm that pass (the driver pretends that 64x64 is the minimum). I did=
n't
look at G2 output very closely, but on RKVDEC, in similar failures we have
perfect keyframe, and a single corrupted tile on the following decode. My b=
elief
is that there is bugs in the drivers to be found and fixed. In absence of v=
endor
support, or working reference it will be difficult / near impossible to fix=
, but
I'm documenting this so we stop thinking this is just "not supported".

cheers,
Nicolas
