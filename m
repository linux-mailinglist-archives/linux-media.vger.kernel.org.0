My Dear Friend.

Greetings,

My name is Mr. Mohammad Ahmed , the account manager in charge of audit
Foreign Remittance Unit, bank  in Burkina Faso, It is true that we
have not meet each other in person, but I strongly believe in trust
and friendship in every business. As I am contacting you independently
of my investigation and no one is informed of this communication.

My reason for contacting you is to transfer an abandoned sum of
$13.5million Dollars immediately to your private account. The money
has been here in our Bank lying dormant for years now without anybody
coming for the claim of it.

The funds belong to our Late deceased Customer Mr.Cemil Bullent Ciner
who perished along with her family in the Plane Crash since 15 years
ago The Banking laws here does not allow such money to stay more than
10 years, that is the reason why I need your Cooperation in
transferring the money to your bank account so that we can use it to
secure the future of our both families because I don't want the money
to be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

My dear you will provide account for transfer of the fund in your
favor by our bank management and once the fund transferred into your
account 50% from the total sum is for you and 50% for me and do not
entertain any atom for fear for the transaction will be done legal and
official without any problem.

By indicating your interest I will send you the full details on how
the business will be executed. Please keep this proposal as a top
secret and delete if you are not interested. My position as the chief
auditor in this bank guarantees the successful execution of this
(deal) transaction.

1)your full name.....
2) sex.....
3) age.....
4) country.....
5)passport or photo.....
6)occupation.....
7) personal Mobile number.....
8)Home &office address.....
9) Your marital status........

Thanks.

Mr.Mohammad Ahmed.
