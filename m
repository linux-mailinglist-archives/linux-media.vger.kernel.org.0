There is two schools in the context of video stream decoding. I'm not sayin=
g
this driver is quite there in term of visual corruption reporting, this is
something I expect we'll improve in the long term. But here's the two schoo=
ls:

- Freeze on the last non-corrupted image (Apple style)
- Display slightly distorted image with movement (the rest of the world)

In order to give users that choice, I must try decoding as much as I can
regardless if there is a missing a reference or not. That wasn't the goal i=
n
this MR, but in the long run we'll remember this and mark the buffer as
corrupted (using the ERROR but setting a payload size to the picture size).=
 This
leaves the users the option to drop or to keep the visually corrupted image=
. In
video streaming, corrupted stream could look relatively fine, this cannot b=
e
judge noticing 1 reference frame missing (it could be referenced in only 1
macro-block).

Educational bit behind, I think we should keep going and not "error out". A=
lso,
for debugging purpose, it is nicer if we can get a complete report of non-m=
emory
backed references. As a missing reference in 1 frame, may have implication =
in
later frame, or may cause other frames to be missed.

One thing I was thinking though, is that through using raw pr_debug() I'm n=
ot
giving much context to my trace, so it would be hard to associate it with t=
he
driver instance (m2m are multi-instance) it was running against. But I didn=
't
want to add a new tracing wrapper for that driver in this patchset as it wa=
s
already relatively large patchset. Though, these traces have been previous =
to
make the driver work (as long as you test with a single instance).

If its all right with everyone, I'd leave it like this for this round, we c=
an
dedicated a patchset on improve this driver tracing in the future.

I'll do that in v2, in same patch, looks minor enough. I think if using boo=
l
could guaranty that only 1 or 0 is  possible, it would be even better, but =
don't
think C works like this.

Thanks again for your comments.
