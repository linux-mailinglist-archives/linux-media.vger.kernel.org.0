We've had a couple of these cases recently where people have taken
some old property implemented by i915 and implemented it differently
in some other driver. Dunno if the reason was that people didn't try
to understand what i915 is doing and why, or they misundestood it,
or they understood it but decided to ignore it anyway.

Unfortunately having undocumented corners in the uapi is simply
a fact of life when dealing with a >15 year old legacy codebase.
Also there were basically no rules regarding properties in the
past, so everyone just added random properties whenever they 
felt like it.

I think going forward we should probably lay down some extra
ground rules; if an old undocumented uapi is being extended
to cover more than one driver we must first figure out what
the de facto semantics are, and document things properly
before anything else gets done.
