Thanks from me as well.

I've got six of saa7146 based DVB-S2 budget cards still in use.
Apparently You can still buy a new one[1] which is supported by budget
driver.

There is ongoing discussion in VDR community about converting to vb2,
albeit it's very slow and I don't know yet if it'll reach a conclusion.
And, as proposed, keeping it in staging area or keeping the driver with
stripped analog video capabilities would definitely help.

Thank You, that would certainly make me satisfied. Would that mean that
after removing analog video support, driver would go out of staging, back
to maintained area?
