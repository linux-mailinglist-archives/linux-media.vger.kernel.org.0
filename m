I think it doesn't really matter what the initial format is, as long as 
it's valid for the subdev itself. There are two separate things:

1) Subdev config, where the subdev is considered independently from the 
other subdevs. E.g. the formats in the input pads and output pads should 
be valid, taking into account the capabilities of the subdev. The subdev 
driver has to take care of these, i.e. if the user sets a format on a 
pad, the driver must adjust the other pads (if needed) to keep the 
subdev config valid.

2) pipeline validation, where all the subdevs in the pipeline are looked 
at and validated that the settings are compatible.

We're talking about 1) here, and it doesn't matter if the camera 
supports the csirx initial format or not.
