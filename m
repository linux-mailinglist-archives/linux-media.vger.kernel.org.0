I meant queuing it to the hardware, in the sense that programming the
register doesn't make the hardware process the buffer immediately, but
you're right, that's not a good term here. I'll use "programs the next
buffer".

You're right. I'll write "that udpates buf_num when it programs the next
buffer".
