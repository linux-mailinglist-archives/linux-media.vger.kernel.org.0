This will mean around 1000 changed lines in 350 files.

Given the number of changes and how they're scattered around, I'd expect
to merge first the Runtime PM API change, then later on the driver specific
changes via their own trees. Doing it differently risks a large number of
conflicts.

Hopefully faster than changing the I²C driver probe function though.

We also need to have some time before all users of
pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() have been converted, including new ones merged
meanwhile.
