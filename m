Thanks for your reply!
I will update the related reason in the patch later.

The reason for adding this check is that we met a case that the user
sent an invalid size(It seems it's a negative value, MSB is 0xff, it's
larger than DRAM size after convert it to size_t) to dma-heap to alloc
memory, and this allocation was running on a process(such as "gralloc"
on Android device) can't be killed by OOM flow, and we also couldn't
find the related dmabuf in "dma_buf_debug_show" because the related
dmabuf was not exported yet since the allocation is still on going.

Since this invalid argument case can be prevented at dma-heap side, so,
I added this size check, and moreover, to let debug it easily, I also
added logs when size is bigger than a threshold we set in mtk system
heap.
If you think that print logs in dma-heap framework is better, I will
update it in next version.

If you have better solution(such as dump the size under allocating
in "dma_buf_debug_show", which maybe need add global variable to record
it), please kindly let me know.
Thanks :)
