Yes, I think it looks and sounds like there are two threads running when
there are two streams.

so in effect, although they 'share a pipe', aren't they in effect just
sending two separate buffers through their stream-path?

If that's the case, then I don't think there's any frame corruption,
because they would both have grabbed their own frame separately.


I don't think that's a good example of the hardware though, as that
doesn't reflect what 'should' happen where the TPG runs once to generate
a frame at the sensor, which is then read by both the debayer entity and
the RAW capture device when there are two streams...


So I suspect trying to move to a single thread is desirable, but that
might be a fair bit of work also.
