I ran this series through smatch and found these two issues:

drivers/staging/media/rkvdec/rkvdec-hevc.c: In function 'transpose_and_flatten_matrices':
drivers/staging/media/rkvdec/rkvdec-hevc.c:429:83: warning: variable 'new_value' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  429 |         int i, j, row, x_offset, matrix_offset, rot_index, y_offset, matrix_size, new_value;
      |                                                                                   ^~~~~~~~~
drivers/staging/media/rkvdec/rkvdec-hevc.c:756 rkvdec_hevc_run_preamble() error: we previously assumed 'ctrl' could be null (see line 755)

Also, this series drops the HEVC part from the TODO file, but
I wonder if the last remaining item is still valid:

* Evaluate introducing a helper to consolidate duplicated
  code in rkvdec_request_validate and cedrus_request_validate.
  The helper needs to the driver private data associated with
  the videobuf2 queue, from a media request.

It doesn't look like there is much duplicate code at all. It is certainly not
something that prevents this driver from moving out of staging.

Regards,

	Hans
