Well, I haven't test this.

I'm not an usual python programmer, so, don't know much about its 
specifics... Yet, I would be expecting that something like this:

	try:
	    extensions.append("rst2pdf.pdfbuilder")
	except:
	    sys.stderr.write('rst2pdf extension not available.\n')
	

Would avoid it to crash, if the extension is not available.
Silly me :-)

Still, I suspect that it should not be hard to modify the above to
avoid the crash. 

I shouldn't be doing much development those days, as I'm taking
some vacations, after sending media stuff for 5.11. 

So, if you have a better idea about how to optionally probe an
extension, feel free to modify my patch.

Yeah. I guess one of the issues is with tables that don't fit into
a single page.

Yet, devicetree book is empty. That sounds really weird, as there are
few files on it, and I didn't see anything uncommon on the rst files.

Sounds like a plan.

Thanks,
