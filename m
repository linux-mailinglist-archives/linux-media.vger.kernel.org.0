Hello Rob,

In this case, though, since I do have knowledge about the platform, it's probably
worth for me to try to address some of your questions, on at least this one.

Probably, oneOf is not the right choice here... "mediatek,mt8183-mdp3" is needed
to probe the "main" mdp3 core pdev, while RDMA0 is a necessary component (as in
this driver uses the component framework, and rdma0 is required for functionality,
as far as I understand).

This shouldn't be a choice, meaning that defining mdp3-rdma0 without mdp3 is
completely useless, as there wouldn't be anything else initializing that component,
nor sub-components of that.

The wanted logic here (I believe) is that, depending on firmware capabilities
and/or platform/board capabilities, you may miss some subcomponents like IMGI
and/or EXTO.
As for DL1/2 and PATH1/2... DL1+PATH1 is surely critically necessary for the
functionality of the MDP3 RDMA... I don't know whether it's possible that we
get any fw/platform/device that's not using DL2/PATH2 at all.

Moudy, can you please explain?

There's a story behind that one: this was part of mtk (display) DRM drivers, then
it was moved to soc/mediatek/mtk-mutex.c as it started being shared.

I wonder if the mm-mutex can be rewritten and moved to hwspinlock... this driver
is growing and now, with the introduction of MDP3, we're seeing some more.

Though, it's definitely worth mentioning that the usage of MediaTek's mm-mutex is
varying a bit between the drm case and the mdp3 case as, here, we have a "command
queue" mechanism that is used for commands ordering in HW.
This is a very complex architecture that has very specific requirements.
For how I see it, migrating that to hwspinlock would require an almost complete
reimplementation of soc/mediatek/*, which would take a considerable amount of
time and efforts.
I'm mostly sure that I can help with that, but for how things are looking right

now, between refactoring, getting code solid, going through sane reviews and a
final merge, I'd say that this will take 8-12 months from now.

For this reason, I would propose to perform a slow and steady migration of the
MediaTek mmsys, scpsys, mutex over time, but only after getting in the support
for the new SoCs and functionality for the older ones, provided in this series
and some others that were already sent by MTK, half (or more) of which have
already been merged.

This can probably be, instead, something like

compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-mdp3-rsz";
reg = < .... >;
mediatek,instance-id = <0>;
gce reg, clocks, blah...

or

compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-mdp3-rsz";
reg = < ...rsz0... >, < ...rsz1... >;
reg-names = "rsz0", "rsz1";
gce reg, clocks, blah...


...In any case, if MediaTek chose to separate these like that, I guess that
there will be differences in newer SoCs that would make that kind of binding
much necessary.

Please Moudy, can you explain why you didn't write that like the examples
that I provided there?
