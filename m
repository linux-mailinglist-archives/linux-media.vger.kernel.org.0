Ok. So the changes cover the HFI interface. Is that correct?

This is not how it usually works. Especially not with the patches you
have posted.

I have the following suggestion how this story can continue:
You can _start_ by reworking venus driver, separating the HFI /
firmware / etc interface to an internal interface in the driver. Then
implement Iris as a plug in for that interface. I might be mistaken
here, but I think this is the way how this can be beneficial for both
the video en/decoding on both old and new platforms.

Short rationale:
The venus driver has a history of supported platforms. There is
already some kind of buffer management in place. Both developers and
testers have spent their effort on finding issues there. Sending new
driver means that we have to spend the same amount of efforts on this.
Moreover, even from the porter point of view. You are creating new
bindings for the new hardware. Which do not follow the
venus-common.yaml. And they do not follow the defined bindings for the
recent venus platforms. Which means that as a developer I have to care
about two different ways to describe nearly the same hardware.
