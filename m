Hello my dear friend,

   I sent this mail praying it will get to you in a good condition of
health, since I my self are in a very critical health condition in
which I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the
next day I am Mrs, Grayson Jackie, I have decided to donate what I
have to you, I plead that you will not expose or betray this trust and
confidence that I am about to propose to you for the mutual benefit of
the orphans and the less privilege onces, I am dying and diagnosed for
cancer for about 2 years ago and I am suffering from a long time brain
tumor. I have been touched by God Almighty to donate from what I have
inherited from my late husband to you for good work of GodAlmighty. I
have asked Almighty God to forgive me and I believe he has because he
is a Merciful God, I will be going in for an operation soon and i dont
know if i will survive from this very operation according to my doctor
and some  medical check up.I decided to donate the sum of ($11.5
million Dollars) to you for the good work of God Almighty, and also to
help the motherless and lessprivilege and also forth assistance of the
widows. At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due
to the fact that my relatives (that have squandered the funds i gave
them for this purpose before) are around me and my health status also.
I have adjusted my will and my lawyer is aware.

  I wish you all the best and May the good God bless you abundantly,
and please. use this funds judiciously and always extend the good work
to others. As soon you get back to me, I shall give you information on
what I need from you then you will contact the bank and tell them I
have willed those properties to you by quoting my personal file
routing and account information. And I have also notified the bank
that I am willing to sent out my late husband inherited fund to you
for a good and effective work for in the sight of God for eternal life
and in the sight of man, for witness of God=E2=80=99s mercy and glory upon =
our
lives. I know i don't know you or meet each other before, I know that
everything is controlled by God as there is nothing impossible to him
to do.
If you are interested in carrying out this task, get back to me for
more details on this noble project of mine.
May god bless you and your family and those that you care for,
Best Regards,
Mrs, Grayson Jackie.
Writting From the hospital.
May God Bless you,
