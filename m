That's right, but pipeline start (which includes validation and resource
reservation) needs to be performed synchronously with VIDIOC_STREAMON.
The streaming state managed by vb2 is not relevant,
media_pipeline_start() must not be delayed the same way
.start_streaming() is.

I'm not opposed to helper functions to implement that, they can bundle
vb2 calls and pipeline management.

It's not just about giving more control to drivers, it's about
organizing the software layers in a way that keeps them maintainable,
with layered abstractions and not midlayers.

We are extensively reworking the media pipeline management as part of
the stream series, and there will be more work on top of that that will
make even more fundamental changes. I would like to at least postpone
any work on vb2 until then, to be able to evaluate the impact.
