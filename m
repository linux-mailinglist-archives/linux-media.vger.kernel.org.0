I'm not sure I understand the above.

If a blacklist entry is added to acpi_graph_ignore_port(),
acpi_nondev_subnode_extract() will bail out for all of the ports on
the given system regardless of their role etc.  Still, it is expected
that requisite nodes will be added somewhere else and the camera will
be handled because some platform data has been compiled into the
kernel for this purpose.  Or is my understanding incorrect?

If it is correct, the blacklisting mechanism might be replaced with a
whitelisting one where acpi_nondev_subnode_extract() will not bail out
on systems that are known to be good.

OK, so this is a result of the vendor trying to support Linux in a
home-grown way which now is blowing up IIUC.

Or do you mean something else?
