This should be:

	if (!q->min_reqbufs_allocation)

>>> +             q->min_reqbufs_allocation = 2;

and vsp1 should set q->min_reqbufs_allocation to 1.

The reasoning behind all this is that VIDIOC_REBUFS is expected to allocate
a sane (i.e. workable and efficient) number of buffers.

So if the DMA engine requires at least X buffers queued, then the minimum
reqbufs allocation is at least q->min_queued_buffers + 1, otherwise you
would never be able to get a buffer back.

That's also why q->min_reqbufs_allocation was set to a minimum of 2: one
buffer in flight, one buffer processed by userspace. That made the queue_setup
call simpler for quite a few drivers that manually set the buffer count to 2.
For most drivers, allocating 2 buffers makes perfect sense.

But if a driver sets q->min_reqbufs_allocation explicitly to 1, then that
should be honored, and my proposed change above will do that.

Laurent, if you agree with this, just post patches for this.

	Hans
