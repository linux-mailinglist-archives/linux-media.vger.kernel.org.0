bio_vec's themselves don't support chaining... In the block layer they
are used in a struct bio which handles chaining, splitting and other
features. Each bio, though, has a limit of 256 segments to avoid higher
order allocations. Depending on your use case, you could reuse bios or
write your own container to chain bio_vecs.

I'd probably avoid the u64 here and leave space for some flags or
something. If you have >1GB to map you can always just have mulitple
segments. With 4GB per segment and 256 segments per page, a page of DMA
sgs can easily map 1TB of memory in a single call and with chaining or
larger allocations you can extend that further, if needed.
