Hi Laurent,

Right now I have the following scenario, after re-plugging it in for 3 
times it started working again as it should, then I changed the setting 
for Video Format and I get the following in the kernel log:

[15207.692208] uvcvideo 2-4:1.1: Failed to set UVC probe control : -32 
(exp. 34).
