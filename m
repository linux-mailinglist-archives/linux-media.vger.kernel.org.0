More and more people are using sysfs/kernfs now for things that it was
never designed for (i.e. high-speed statistic gathering).  That's not
the fault of kernfs, it's the fault of people thinking it can be used
for stuff like that :)

But delays like this is odd, tearing down sysfs attributes should
normally _never_ be a fast-path that matters to system throughput.  So
offloading it to a workqueue makes sense as the attributes here are for
objects that are on the fast-path.
