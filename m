I'm not all that keen on breaking userspace for those who do NOT use the
Atmel BSP. Basically some platforms are currently broken, and with this patch
series some other platforms are broken, but at least can be fixed by changing
userspace.

How feasible is it to do something similar that TI did for the cal driver?
(drivers/media/platform/ti/cal)

I.e., based on a module option the MC is enabled or disabled. And if a
csi2dc is present, then the MC API is always enabled.

Regards,

	Hans
