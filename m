I think the fence in GPU is something attached to per frame 
buffer(IN_FENCE) or completing the render(OUT_FENCE).

So when we enqueue a buffer, what are expecting from the fence?

I think in KMS, you can't enqueue two buffers for the same plane, you 
have to wait the OUT_FENCE.

That is not about what vendor would do. I was thinking we are planning 
how we manage the lifetime of the reconstruction buffer, reference 
selecting based on a simple GOP model.
What was designed here would become a barrier for a vendor whose 
hardware has a little capability than this.

All I want to do here is offer my ideas about how we could achieve an 
open interfaces that could cover the future need.

Especially it is hard to expand the V4L2 uAPIs.
