I've confused the USB packet size and the UVC payload size. The latter
is typically much bigger for bulk devices than isoc devices, but the
former will be in similar order of magnitudes in a large number of
cases, but not all cases.

The URB size is the result of the USB packet size and number of packets
per URB. The uvcvideo driver currently sets the number of packets per
URB to 32 at most (and lowers it if the frame size is small, or if not
enough memory can be allocated). This could be increased or made dynamic
in the future, as higher speeds typically benefit from larger URB sizes.
The packet size differs between bulk and isoc endpoints.

For bulk, the packet size can be up to 512 bytes for USB 2.0 and 1024
bytes for USB 3.0, and the device can select a smaller size. The largest
URB size (again based on the current implementation of the uvcvideo
driver) is thus 32 KiB.

For isochronous the situation is more complicated. The term "packet" as
used in the uvcvideo driver actually means all the data transferred in
one service interval, thus made of multiple isoc packets. It is heavily
dependent on the USB speed, and the device can advertise different
supported sizes (which translate directly to the reserved bandwidth for
the transfer), with the driver picking the smallest bandwidth large
enough for the data rate required by the resolution and frame rate. The
theoretical worst case is 1024 bytes per isoc packet * 16 isoc packets
per burst * 6 burst per interval * 32 "packets" per URB, equal to 3 MiB.

Even with the largest URB size you have witnessed of ~1 MiB, we will end
up lying quite a bit if we consider the URB completion callback for the
first URB of the frame as indicating the start of reception.

As I think everybody is aware, the earliest notification you get on the
CPU side is the *end* of reception of the first URB, which can possibly
be significantly later than the start of reception of the frame.

Based on what I understand, the goal is to measure the CPU power
consumption related to CPU processing of the frame. If that's the case,
there's good and bad news. The good news is that the CPU doesn't process
the frame at all until the URB has been received (if you were to measure
the power consumption of the USB host controller too, it would be a
different story), so the delay shouldn't be a problem. The bad news is
that I don't see how the information you're trying to get will help you,
as there's plenty of other things unrelated to the uvcvideo driver that
can take CPU time while a frame is being received. That may not be any
of my business, but from the point of view of the uvcvideo driver, I'm
less inclined to accept a possibly significant V4L2_EVENT_FRAME_SYNC lie
if the use case ends up making little sense :-)
