Good point, indeed.

Getting the kernel to set the layer IDs, unless we have a full SVC configur=
ation
would just be extra indirections. That being said, if we mention HEVC, thes=
e IDs
can be modified in-place as they use a fixed number of bytes. If you can sp=
lit
the headers appart, generating per layer headers in application makes a lot=
 of
sense.

Traditionally, slice headers are made by stateless accelerators, but not th=
e
SPS/PPS and friend.

You can use any encoders to create a temporal SVC. Its only about the
referencing pattern, made so you can reduce the framerate (dividing by 2
usually).

For spatial layer, the encoders need scaling capabilities. I'm not totally =
sure
how multi-view work, but this is most likely just using left eye as referen=
ce
(not having an I frame ever for the second eye).

>=20
> Also do you know if we have stateful codecs supporting SVC?

We don't at the moment, they all produce headers with layer id hardcoded to=
 0 as
far as I'm aware. The general plan (if it had continued) might have been to
offer a memu based control, and drivers could offer from a list of preset S=
VC
pattern. Mimicking what browsers needs:
