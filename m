One thing we are looking at these days, and aren't current controllable in
stateful interface is RTP RPSI (reference picture selection indication). Th=
is is
feedback that a remote decoder sends when a reference picture has been deco=
ded.
In short, even if only 1 reference is used, we'd like the reference to chan=
ge
only when we received the acknowledgement that the new one has been
reconstructed on the other side.

I'm not super keep in having to modify the Linux kernel specially for this
feature. Specially that similar API offer it at a lower level (VA, D3D12, a=
nd
probably future API).

In Television (and Youtube) streaming, the GOP size is just fixed, and you =
deal
with it. In fact, I never seen GOP or picture pattern being modified by the=
 rate
control. In general, the high end rate controls will follow an HRD
specification. The rate controls will require information that represent
constraints, this is not limited to the rate. In H.264/HEVC, the level and
profile will play a role. But you could also add the VBV size and probably =
more.
I have never read the HRD specification completely.

In cable streaming notably, the RC job is to monitor the about of bits over=
 a
period of time (the window). This window is defined by the streaming hardwa=
re
buffering capabilities. Best at this point is to start reading through HRD
specifications, and open source rate control implementation (notably x264).

I think overall, we can live with adding hints were needed, and if the gop
information is appropriate hint, then we can just reuse the existing contro=
l.

Ack. For us, this is also why we would require requests (unlike statful
encoder), as we have per frame information to carry, and requests explicitl=
y
attach the information to the frame.

Ack. We need a compromise here.

Of course, the subject is much more relevant when there is encoders with mo=
re
then 1 reference. But you are correct, what the commands do, is allow to ch=
ange,
add or remove any reference from the list (random modification), as long as=
 they
fit in the codec contraints (like the DPB size notably). This is the only w=
ay
one can implement temporal SVC reference pattern, robust reference trees or=
 RTP
RPSI. Note that long term reference also exists, and are less complex then =
these
commands.

I this raises a big question, and I never checked how this worked with let'=
s say
VA. Shall we let the driver resolve the changes into commands (VP8 have
something similar, while VP9 and AV1 are refresh flags, which are just triv=
ial
to compute). I believe I'll have to investigate this further.

Ack,

From what we have in our pretty thin documentation, references are being
"searched" for fuzzy match and motion. So when you pass 2 references to the
encoder, then the encoder will search equally in both. I suspect it does a =
lot
more then that, and saves some information in the auxiliary buffers that ex=
ist
per reference, but this isn't documented and I'm not specialized enough rea=
lly.

From usage perspective, all you have to do is give it access to the referen=
ces
picture data (reconstructed image and auxiliary data). The result is compre=
ssed
macroblock data that may refer to these. We don't really know if it is used=
, but
we do assume it is and place it in the reference list. This is of course no=
rmal
thing to do, specially when using a reference fifo.

In theory, you could implement multiple reference with a HW that only suppo=
rts
1. A technique could be to compress the image multiple time, and keep the "=
best"
one for the current configuration. Though, a proper multi-pass encoder woul=
d
avoid the bandwidth overhead of compressing and writing the temporary resul=
t.

No worries, let's do that later then. On our side, we have similar limitati=
on,
since we have to have something working before we can spend more time in tu=
rning
it into something upstream. So we have "something" for VP8, we'll do "somet=
hing"
for H.264, from there we should be able to iterate. But having the opportun=
ity
to iterate over a more capable hardware would clearly help understand the b=
igger
picture.
