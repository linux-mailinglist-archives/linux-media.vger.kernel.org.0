Trying to do a full build (kernel + dts) will fail, because the the
device-tree patch references the newly added reset-id .

So you end up with a dtc error. Same with the binding.


I think in the past to uncouple this we did reference the id by number
first:

+      resets =3D <&cru SRST_A_HDMIRX>, <&cru SRST_P_HDMIRX>,
+               <&cru SRST_HDMIRX_REF>, <&cru 660>;

Had the id-addition separately and then a later series for kernel x+1
to convert from 660 to SRST_A_HDMIRX_BIU .

I think I wrote exactly that in my original reply :-)
