That's not quite true; the point is that if you use BIT() consistently,
then even when you refer to bits 32 to 63 you won't accidentally
introduce shifts of more than the width of int, and the definition will
work equally well for assembly and C, which isn't true if you use `1UL`
in the definition.

With that in mind it's shorter and clearer than its functional
equivalent:

  BIT(x)
  (UL(1) << (x))

So IMO it's preferable to use BIT() generally, or _BITUL() in uapi
headers.

Thanks,
Mark.
