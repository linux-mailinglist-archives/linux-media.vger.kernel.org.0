I'm really hopeful it will be merged very soon. As you may have noticed (!) we
have problems with maintaining the media subsystem (too many patches, not enough
maintainers). We had a meeting about that a few weeks ago and are working on
it.

The core problem for this particular series was that the PR containing this series
was posted much too late (as in three months too late!), and it came in too late
for 6.5.

Regards,
