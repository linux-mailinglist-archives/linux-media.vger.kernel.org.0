"Taking some time" doesn't necessarily mean "abandoned". I agree that
more often that not we've seen code dumped in staging and left there
unmaintained. Once bitten, twice shy (or as we say in French, a scalded
cat fears cold water), but let's not necessarily assume the worst
possible outcome :-)

Of course, if StarFive wants to speed up development of the ISP support,
both on the kernel side and libcamera side, I'm sure Kieran and I can
help (possibly not very fast if it is only done in our spare time
though, but that's a separate discussion).
