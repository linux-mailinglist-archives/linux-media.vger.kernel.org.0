So if I pass a non-secure dma fd to the capture queue of the codec, who
will check that it can't write the data to that fd? Since doing so would
expose the video. Presumably at some point the tee code will prevent that?
(I sincerely hope so!)

Having a separate V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF_SECURE type is to indicate to the
driver that 1) it can expect secure dmabuf fds, 2) it can configure itself
for that (that avoids using a control to toggle between normal and secure mode),
and at VIDIOC_QBUF time it is easy for the V4L2 core to verify that the
fd that is passed in is for secure memory. This means that mistakes by
userspace are caught at QBUF time.

Of course, this will not protect you (people can disable this check by
recompiling the kernel), that still has to be done by the firmware, but
it catches userspace errors early on.

Also, while for this hardware the DMA operation is the same, that might
not be the case for other hardware.
