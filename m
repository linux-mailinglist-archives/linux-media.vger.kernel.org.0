Yes I understand that these aspects need to be tested too, but I feel like
having an implementation with a feedback look (even rudimentary and using
some generic helpers) would be quite a stretch.

It would probably be sufficient to have some demo code that can receive sta=
ts
and set parameters, but without necessarily any connection between the two.
As such it's also my feeling that a standalone demo program could be easier
to manage for that purpose than libcamera support.

So how about making the requirement that a (free software) userspace
implementration must demonstrate ability to read relevant statistics
=66rom the ISP and (independently) control parameters that affect the outpu=
t?
