Hmm, that would require also soldering the connector and it seems like
no standard thing, so I would need to create an adaptor. At least I do
not find anything on ebay which looks like it can be attached to the
Pandaboard.

Well, I guess before adding the resizer stuff, I want to see a picture
influenced by what is in front of the camera of a device I really care
about (!= pandaboard) and then adjusting things to the point where
format configurations are solved. At some point more could also jump
in to screw at sensor chip drivers.
