Sorry if my reply was a bit harsh too, it was of course nothing personal but
I really felt like this issue was not being considered seriously.

Sure I understand that we don't want to introduce a compatible for which we
don't have a clear idea of the resources/hardware constraints. I fully agree
that there shouldn't be a fallback on a rk3066-cif for the px30.

My opinion is that the two things are separate and that as long as we know
it's the same unit, it should be fine to name the file after the first
generation even if it is not yet described in the binding. I find that it's=
 a
bit unusual, yes, but I wouldn't go as far as calling it confusing.

The description text can clearly mention that the first occurrence of the u=
nit
is in the RK3066 and thus it will be clear why the file is named after it.
Also people looking for binding documentation for the px30 vip will still e=
asily
find it with the usual git grep. So I don't really see any serious downside.

That would be agreeable to me if my proposal still ends up feeling unreason=
able
to you. But I might very well take you at your word since I ended up purcha=
sing
a RK3066 board in a moment of weakness last week.

Cheers,
