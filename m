Those two parameters are very rare to be used and it is expected that 
users with the corresponding HW (signal source/displays) will either be 
experts on that topic or they will simply get the parameters as "magic 
numbers" from us after we test the HW and obtain the correct values. As 
far as I can decipher the info from the HW engineers, this is a quiet 
non-standard parameter that is hard to find in any documentation, but 
for some "exotic" systems it is required for the mgb4 to work with the 
corresponding HW.

I have not put the defaults here because in most cases the "default" is 
that this value is not used (the signal has VSYNC/HSYNC). And when it is 
needed, the value has to be changed to fit the HW anyway as chances to 
match any default value are almost zero. All other values are the 
defaults of a particular display/entertainment system (Škoda Octavia 
III)* but here I myself (unlike the HW people) have not even access to 
any HW to test it...

One can however always read-out the value if he desperately needs the 
default value.

* Officially this is the reference system that shall be quiet accessible 
for the customers as this infotainment system is quite widespread in the 
VW concern, but the real reason is, it is the system laying on my desk ;-)
