      URGENT ATTENTION FOR YOUR BENEFIT WINNING NOTIFICATION TO EMAIL OWNER=
S

We write in regards to your delayed Contract/Inheritance Funds in the
sum of Twenty Seven Million United States Dollars (US$27,000,000.00)
which you are yet to receive as a result of your inability to raise
the required fee(s) to conclude your Transaction.

The United Nations has decided to proffer a solution that will make it
easier for all the Beneficiaries to receive their Funds. We understood
that some Fees are required in order process and Transfer your Funds
into your Account. We are also aware that most Beneficiaries do not
have these required fees. We have therefore deliberated with the Bank
in charge of this payment to allow Beneficiaries the privilege of
receiving their Funds in two (2) or three (3) installments. In this
case,  Beneficiaries will no longer be required to pay the fee at once
but part of it depending on the number of installments such
Beneficiary will like his/her Funds to be released to him/her.

Write the Bank and request that you want your fund to be transferred
to your account by installments payment,(ATM & Wire transfer) so that
once the first payments enters into your account you can then use
money from there to facilitate the transfer of the remaining
balance,once the first installments enters into your account
withdrawal from your account to Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) .Online
transfer procedure.

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)  in which is now in charge of your
Payment has agreed to give the Beneficiaries the option of receiving
their Funds at once, in two or three installments. Therefore, you
should send him your full Name and telephone number/your correct
mailing address.

What a shame and embarrassment? If actually, you have spent money to
execute this contract and have spent money in the hands of the
fraudsters and impostors without achieving your goal in receiving this
fund, what stops you from giving out one chance benefit of doubt and
sacrifice with this token fee to see your fund payment successfully
completed?

This will help the beneficiaries to pay part of the fee and receive
part of their Funds with which such beneficiary can upset the
remaining fee and receive his/her complete Funds.To break this
down:Two Hundred and Fifity Dollars Dollars ($250) fee will facilitate
the release of  Seven Million United States Dollars (US$7,000,000.00)
only. Four Hundred Dollars ($400) fee will facilitate the release of
Two Million United States Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) only.

Six Hundred and Fifity Dollars ($650) fee which is the total fee will
facilitate the release of your Full Contract/inheritance Funds in the
sum of Twenty Seven Million United States Dollars (US 27,000,000.00).
However, Feel free to inform us how much you can raise should you
cannot afford any of the above Mentioned installment so as for us to
talk to the Bank to know how much out of your Funds they could release
to you with the amount you can come up with.

This is the best the United Nations can do for you and you are advised
to take advantage of this opportunity. Kindly, Get back to me
immediately with your option so that i will forward you the contact
person at the paying Board of Directors Central  Bank of Nigeria
(CBN). to indicate your preferred option.

Contact Name: Board of Directors
Contact Receiver: Mrs. Chioma Mordi

Please make sure that you didn't hesitate making the payment down to
the agency by today so that  they could have the  certificate
endorsed, signed and stamped immediately  without  any  further delay.

have to proceed to the bank tomorrow for the transfer of your
compensation funds which is valued at the sum of $27.000,000.00 usd
which was suppose to have been transferred to you all this while.
