Just complementing: on media, we do this per video buffer (or
per half video buffer). A typical use case on cameras is to have
buffers transferred 30 times per second, if the video was streamed 
at 30 frames per second. 

I would assume that, on an audio/video stream, the audio data
transfer will be programmed to also happen on a regular interval.

So, if the video stream is programmed to a 30 frames per second
rate, I would assume that the associated audio stream will also be
programmed to be grouped into 30 data transfers per second. On such
scenario, if the audio is sampled at 48 kHZ, it means that:

1) each M2M transfer commanded by CPU will copy 1600 samples;
2) the time between each sample will remain 1/48000;
3) a notification event telling that 1600 samples were transferred
   will be generated when the last sample happens;
4) CPU will do time control by looking at the notification events.
