Here's some links to the current userspace implementation built on top
of the MTK patches (and yeah, this'll end up changing based on what
happens upstream).

1. This is where we are decrypting the video to a secure buffer, it's
invoking IPC into a closed source component to do that:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/chromeos=
/decoder_buffer_transcryptor.cc;l=3D87
2. This is where we aren enabling secure mode:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/v4l2/v4l=
2_video_decoder.cc;l=3D412
3. This is where we are resolving secure buffers to secure handles:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/v4l2/v4l=
2_video_decoder.cc;l=3D535
(the allocation of the secure buffers is done in closed source CDM
code, but it's just opening the dma-buf heap and issuing the ioctl to
allocate it)
4. This is where we submit the secure buffers to the output queue:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/v4l2/v4l=
2_queue.cc;l=3D816
(this is nothing special, since it's just passing in the fd)
5. For the capture queue, there's zero changes in Chrome V4L2 code for
that...it's all transparent to user space that it's a secure surface
that's being rendered to. We do allocate them w/ different flags via
minigbm which happens here:
https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/chromeos=
