Ah, you have a better memory than I have. That might well be the culprit.
I didn't check for changes in the dvb core, I should have done that.

That patch was introduced in 6.3.7 and reverted in 6.3.9.

That doesn't quite match the "#regzbot introduced: v6.3.5..v6.3.7" report,
though. I wonder if fedora backported that problematic patch to their v6.3.5
release?
