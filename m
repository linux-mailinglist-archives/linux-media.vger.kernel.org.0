We've never agreed :-)

That's not the problem, the issue is that for MC-enabled drivers subdevs
and video nodes are configured in isolation of each other. You thus
can't enumerate formats on a video node *for the current pipeline
configuration* as there's no such thing, we have no global "test"
pipeline configuration. Enumerating formats for the active configuration
is possible, but that will confuse userspace even more, as most
applications enumerate formats first and then decide how to configure
the device based on what is supported.

We need to address this issue in the V4L2 spec first and decide, once
and for all, what set of ioctls MC-based drivers need to support, and
how they should support them. There's little point in sending patches
for the driver until we agree on the spec.
