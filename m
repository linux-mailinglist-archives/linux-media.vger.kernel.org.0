Only because the QS=1 is now mandatory IIRC.
We do always set Q bit explicitly when QS==1.

But yeah, I guess we could always go for full range
by default when QS==1. Or maybe we even did that at
some point in the past and it broke some things?
Can't recall anymore.

Anyways, QS=1 being mandatory is a clear improvement
in CTA-861, but some other CTA-861 rule updates are
more or less pointless as you can't in general detect
which version of the spec the sink claims to implement.

Eg. we already had cases where following the new CTA-861-F
rules for the YQ bit when transmitting RGB broke some
displays. And we are now forced to use the presence of
HDMI 2.0+ capabilities as a heuristic to detect CTA-851-F+.
(see drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range()). It's pretty
nasty.

And I think there is some other infoframe related issue
(something to do with VICs IIRC) where we'd need to derive
the CTA-861 version eg. from the set of advertised VICs
in the EDID. I might have even written some code for that
at some point but never finished it. So it's still
broken in the current code. Can't recall the specific
details right now unfortunately.
