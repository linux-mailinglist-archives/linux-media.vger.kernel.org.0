please don't :)

.. as Sakari suggested, the driver handling the DMA should be in
charge of calling s_stream() on the sensor subdev in its
suspend/resume handlers. There's the risk the receiver resumes while
the sensor is still suspended, and at this time there's no solution in
mainline to handle this correctly.

Laurent/Sakari, how should this be handled for the time being ?

Laurent's patch for imx219 (and his forthcoming patch to remove the
same pattern from all sensor drivers in mainline) might be opening th
door for unexpected bugs as long as we don't enforce a resume/suspend
ordering ?

Can we get a link to the receiver driver you're using in your kernel ?
