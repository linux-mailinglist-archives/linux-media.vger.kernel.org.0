Hi Laurent,

Thanks for your comments.
There is one thing that is still confusing to me (please see my question
below).

If I understand correctly, in a 4:2:0 format, we have 4 luminance
components per chrominance.

And with the YUYV8_1X16, we have 2 luminance per chrominance.

Are you suggesting that, when userspace sets 4:2:0 (NV12, NV21, YU12, YV12),
we should use MEDIA_BUS_FMT_YUYV8_1X16 between the resizer and the DMA engine?

But then, down sampling rate here won't match (this is where my confusion
comes from).

Or, are you assuming that the DMA engine receives 4:2:2 and performs the
conversion?

I would appreciate if you could help clarify this.


Just to note here, in the docs Dafna pointed, it's written:

"The Resize module is able to process luminance and chrominance data
independently, i.e. there are separate pipelines for luminance and
chrominance processing using dedicated scale factors and phase offsets.
This allows format conversion to be done by the Resize block (YCbCr 4:2:2 to
4:2:0, 4:1:1, 4:1:0)."

Thanks
Helen
