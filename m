-- 
How are you and family.
I am Mrs. Diana Markus. I have a (2,900,000.00 USD) MILLION fund that  
I inherited from my late husband and want to donate through you for an  
orphanage and charity project, but I have been suffering from cancer  
for so long now that I was hospitalized for treatment. My fear now is  
what the doctor informed me, after a series of tests on me that I may  
not live long because of the disease and I am afraid of losing this  
fund to the government because they don't care about the poor in  
society.

I will appreciate your honesty and courage to handle this fund to help  
orphans and the charity home.
As soon as I receive your message regarding your interest in this fund  
to help the charity home and the less privileged, I will give you more  
details regarding this fund.

Please contact me immediately after reading this message for more  
details regarding this humanitarian agenda.

God bless you while I await your response.
Your sister.

Ms. Diana Markus
