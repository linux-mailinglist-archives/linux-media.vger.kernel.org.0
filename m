Well, to be fair I only added cropping and made some improvements.

That's strange. Unfortunately I'm not using imx274 anymore since a long
time and don't remember the details, but definitely I did test it and if
there had been 14 missing lines I'm pretty sure I would have noticed.

I'll see if I can remember anything useful, and in case I'll update you.
I would be glad if you can update me on any findings too, maybe they
will help in understanding the problem better.

Regards,
