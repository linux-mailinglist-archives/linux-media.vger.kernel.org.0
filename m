I think Krzysztof meant caching the value in the ar0521_dev structure,
so it doesn't have to be read back. I2C is slow, let's avoid reads as
much as possible.

This being said, if all gain controls are in the same cluster, you won't
need to read back or cache anything yourself, the control framework will
handle that for you.

The issue is that if the user has set different digital gains for the
different channels, you will overwrite them with the same below for all
channels. That's not good.

What you could experiment with is register 0x0204
(analog_gain_code_global) which seem to provide a global analog gain
without overwriting the digital gains, but it's not entirely clear from
the documentation if it will work. The register name comes from
SMIA++/CCS, but the documentation doesn't match the coarse/fine gain
model, experiments would be needed. Another option is register 0x3028,
which is also named analog_gain_code_global, but is documented
differently.

Could you btw read registers 0x0000 to 0x00ff and provide the data ?

I'm also not sure to see the problem.
