Is it runtime configurable?

I have no idea, but it sounds like it isn't. Really what happened here,
is not me having a particular thing I want to see, is getting a response
that implied that there were two different compatibles for the same
hardware, controlled by different drivers.
It does seem to be that way at present, and this is not something I am
willing to ack etc. That's not to say that I am _nacking_ it, just that
I don't understand this enough to ack something that we usually tell
people not to do.
