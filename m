I don't think this would be a problem really, no, but I question the need
to ever access the MIPI specification names in Linux outside this piece of
code. Drivers for cameras, lens controllers and LED flashes generally try
to avoid being specific to a given firmware interface and the established
de facto naming of these properties in the kernel is aligned with
Devicetree.

I'd like to see differences only when the functionality differs, otherwise
they should be the same. Creating a copy when you can modify it is waste of
a bit of memory. On the upside, the object memory could remain const that
way.
