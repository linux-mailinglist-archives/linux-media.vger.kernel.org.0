Sakari, Laurent, do you have opinion regarding how to control the
framerate on this sensor.  It is a YUV sensor but which might also (not
yet made available in this first serie) support RAW format.
Should I expose the g_frame_interval / s_frame_interval or only blanking
ctrls ?

Format fixed in v3, got reply from GC, there were a bit in order to allow
switching the first/second cycle (if referring to parallel way to
transmit).  With that done, MIPI transmitted data are in LE.
