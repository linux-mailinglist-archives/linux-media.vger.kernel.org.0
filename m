That's exactly what it says at the end of the file:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that several of those interfaces are currently commented out, since
they don't have current users.  See the source code.  Other than the dmasync
calls (where the underlying DMA primitives have changed), most of them can
easily be commented back in if you want to use them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So Randy, the answer to your question is that those routines are not 
available any more because nothing needs to use them.  If you would like 
to submit a patch removing the "Working with existing buffers" section 
from the documentation file, feel free to do so.
