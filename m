I think I need some more background. This series is to support a 'Secure Video
Processor' (at least, that's what svp stands for I believe, something that
is not mentioned anywhere in this series, BTW) which is used to decode an
encrypted h264 stream.

First question: how is that stream encrypted? Is that according to some standard?
Nothing is mentioned about that.

I gather that the encrypted stream is fed to the codec as usual (i.e. just put it
in the output buffer and queue it to the codec), nothing special is needed for that.
Except, how does the hardware know it is encrypted? I guess that's where the
control comes in, you have to turn on SVP mode first.

For the capture buffers you need to provide buffers from secure/trusted memory.
That's a dmabuf fd, but where does that come from?

I saw this message:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/CAPj87rOHctwHJM-7HiQpt8Q0b09x0WWw_T4XsL0qT=dS+XzyZQ@mail.gmail.com/T/#u

so I expect that's where it comes from. But I agree that getting this from dma-heaps
seems more natural.

I assume that those capture buffers are inaccessible from the CPU? (Hence 'secure')

For actually displaying these secure buffers you would use drm, and I assume that
the hardware would mix in the contents of the secure buffer into the video output
pipeline? I.e., the actual contents remain inaccessible. And that the video output
(HDMI or DisplayPort) is using HDCP?

I assume you are either decoding to secure memory all the time, or not
at all. That's something you would want to select the moment you allocate
the first buffer. Using the V4L2_MEMORY_ value would be the natural place
for that. A control can typically be toggled at any time, and it makes
no sense to do that for secure streaming.

Related to that: if you pass a dmabuf fd you will need to check somewhere
if the fd points to secure memory or not. You don't want to mix the two
but you want to check that at VIDIOC_QBUF time.

Note that the V4L2_MEMORY_ value is already checked in the v4l2 core,
drivers do not need to do that.

That feels like a more natural place of doing this.
