Sure. I was so focussed on the userspace part and on getting everything
ready for today's release that I completely forgot to run the patches
through get_maintainers.pl and CC the appropriate people and lists.
Sorry about the oversight, I'll make sure to fix it next time.

Speaking of BCM2711/BCM2835 maintenance... :-) This series isn't
complete as it's missing full DT integration of camera sensor modules.
This is handled through DT overlays in the Raspberry Pi downstream
kernel, which are applied to the base DT by the boot loader (a neat
solution in my opinion). I wonder what we should do for mainline.
Ideally we should be able to at least use the DT overlays from the
downstream Raspberry Pi kernel on mainline, but that's not possible
today due to incompatibilities in the base DT (in particular related to
the I2C port to which the camera sensors are connected). Dave, have you
given that a thought by any chance ?

Another more general question for Nicolas, is there a plan to try and
get vc04_services out of staging ?
