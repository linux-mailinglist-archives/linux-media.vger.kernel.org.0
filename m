Oh my, so it's just a terminology issue? :)

This probably should be docummented somewhere. I just thought xSYNC_ACTIVE_HIGH
meant the respective signals are supposed to be HIGH during active phase of data
transmission: that is VSYNC HIGH during entire frame, and HSYNC high during row.

DT bindings documentation doesn't help much either.

And obviously manufacturers are confused too.

HSYNC/VSYNC "low valid" produces what you see on the previous signal capture
I posted. ;)
