Patches are clearly welcome I guess..

I'm not sure I got this part

I think that would be everyone's desire, but drivers have to be moved
away from it

By maintaining compatibility. I suggested to move to runtime_pm() and
wrap _resume/_suspend in s_power(). My understanding is that the two
(runtime_pm/s_power) are mutually exclusive, but even if that was not
the case, runtime_pm is reference counted, hence as long as calls are
balanced this should work, right ?
