It should work when using the other capture nodes that doesn't contain the debayer
in the pipeline.

ok, this requires major changes in Vimc, unless we implement all the conversions
in the capture.

We can implement the conversion in the capture node, we just need to
distinguish when the pipeline generates it and when it requires conversion,
but shouldn't be a problem.

Nice, I'm not familiar with this extension, I'll take a look, thanks for
the pointer.

Thanks
