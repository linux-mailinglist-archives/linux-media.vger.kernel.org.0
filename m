Until the video device has been registered there is no need for locking
since there is no possibility of concurrent access.

Huh? spin_lock_init doesn't take a lock. It just initializes internal
data.

tw686x_init? I assume you mean tw686x_video_init?

What tw686x_video_free() does really should be done in the release function
of the video_device: vdev->release is currently set to video_device_release,
but that should be a custom function that calls dev->dma_ops->free.

No locks should be needed for that.

It is still not clear what your actual problem is: do you have crashes
sometimes? Is there really something wrong?
