I have checked with a few other APIs to be on the safe side.

In VA-API they  use a trick to save space on the last element, therefore 
these two arrays will only be 63 members wide.

In NVDEC, these two arrays are 64 members wide, which is the same as our 
V4L2 stateless implementation.

In DXVA, these two arrays are also 64 members wide

While going through the spec alongside with the libgav1 source code, I 
notice that the index used to index into the two arrays eventually gets 
assigned to tile_info->tile_rows and tile_info->tile_cols, i.e.

https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libgav1/src/src/obu_parser.cc;l=1704;drc=242da5037807dde3daf097ba74f875db83b8b613

https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:third_party/libgav1/src/src/obu_parser.cc;drc=242da5037807dde3daf097ba74f875db83b8b613;l=1729

But the spec says that these variables must be less than or equal to 
MAX_TILE_ROWS (i.e. 64) and MAX_TILE_COLS (i.e. 64), respectively, i.e.:

 > TileCols specifies the number of tiles across the frame. It is a 
requirement of bitstream conformance that TileCols is less
 > than or equal to MAX_TILE_COLS.

 > TileRows specifies the number of tiles down the frame. It is a 
requirement of bitstream conformance that TileRows is less
 > than or equal to MAX_TILE_ROWS.

In which case only the first 64 members would be filled when actually 
submitting to the accelerator, i.e.:

https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:media/gpu/windows/d3d11_av1_accelerator.cc;drc=242da5037807dde3daf097ba74f875db83b8b613;l=316


Given what I said above, I feel confident with the current implementation.

Ok, expect this change on RFC v3.

No, as the non "_FRAME" pixformats are used for the stateful interface.

Ok

Usually we try to keep single-bit flags into a single "flags" field to 
save space. It is not a rule, but tends to get applied most of the time 
(by almost all codec APIs, not only V4L2 stateless)

I did fail to see that delta_lf_multi is only a single bit wide though, 
so by RFC v3 I will possibly have a flag for it as well.

Looking at the other codec APIs in V4L2 stateless, apparently the 
default is to declare the flag using a literal. I will convert the flags 
in AV1 to not use the BIT macro anymore.

Possibly forgotten. Will fix in RFC v3.

I usually only #define constants if they're used in the actual uAPI code 
somehow as opposed to in intermediary steps such as parsing. You can 
still define the spec constants as needed in userspace code. In this 
particular case, you can compute loop_restoration_size[0] by following 
the spec implementation, i.e.:

LoopRestorationSize[ 0 ] = RESTORATION_TILESIZE_MAX >> (2 - lr_unit_shift);

Where you can #define RESTORATION_TILESIZE_MAX 256 in your own userspace 
code without it having to be part of the uAPI. I don't believe that 
drivers will ever use that constant, but those that do may #define it on 
their own code.

 > could you have the V4L2 CID stuff inserted consistently? In some 
places they are inserted before stateless HEVC / after VP8_FRAME, while 
in others they are after VP9_FRAME. I'd expect them all to be at the 
very end of the stateless block, after VP9_FRAME,

I am adding this feedback from Chen-Yu ^ as a sign that the issue it 
talks about will be fixed in RFC v3.
