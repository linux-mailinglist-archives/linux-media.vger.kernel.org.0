Just to add to above, on a second thought we think it would be  better to
still have a separate compatible for TI as you suggested (since we have a
wrapper) so that it allows any customization needed for future. So compatible
enum would look like :

    oneOf:
      - items:
        - const: ti,e5010-jpeg-enc
        - const: img,e5010-jpeg-enc
      - const: img,e5010-jpeg-enc

Thanks for the suggestion.

Regards
Devarsh
