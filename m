True. If you're going to send a series that change things tree-wide I
was thinking that it would be best to address multiple tree-wide changes
at the same time, that would be less churn, especially if it can be
mostly scripted with Coccinelle. That would be my preference (especially
because the issue will then be solved and we'll be able to move to
something else, instead of leaving old code lingering on for a long
time), but it's up to you.
