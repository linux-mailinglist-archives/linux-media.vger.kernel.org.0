A bit late on this discussion, but just wanted to add my +1 that we should
either redesign the uapi, or fix the underlying latency issue in sysfs, or
whatever else is deemed the proper fix.

Making uapi interfaces async in ways that userspace can't discover is a
hack that we really shouldn't consider, at least for upstream. All kinds
of hilarious things might start to happen when an object exists, but not
consistently in all the places where it should be visible. There's a
reason sysfs has all these neat property groups so that absolutely
everything is added atomically. Doing stuff later on just because usually
no one notices that the illusion falls apart isn't great.

Unfortunately I don't have a clear idea here what would be the right
solution :-/ One idea perhaps: Should we dynamically enumerate the objects
when userspace does a readdir()? That's absolutely not how sysfs works,
but procfs works like that and there's discussions going around about
moving these optimizations to other kernfs implementations. At least there
was a recent lwn article on this:

https://lwn.net/Articles/895111/

But that would be serious amounts of work I guess.
