Daniel might hurt me for this, but if you really only need a pointer to 
your context then we could say that using a pointer value for the 
context field is ok as well.

That should be fine as well as long as you can guarantee that it will be 
unique during the lifetime of all it's fences.

We would just have to adjust the documentation a bit.

Well just use a work item for release.
