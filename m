Okay, so that hold would be for frame buffers, not bitstream buffers, right=
?
But yeah, I see that then it could hold onto those buffers until it's
their turn to display and it could be a bigger number of frames,
depending on the complexity of the codec.

I think this is one reason to migrate to the stateless decoder design.

Could you modify another, already existing driver then?
