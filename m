The UAPI and V4L2/videobuf2 changes are in good shape and the only
wrong part is the use of DMA API, which was based on an earlier email
guidance anyway, and a change to the synchronization part . I find
conclusions like the above insulting for people who put many hours
into designing and implementing the related functionality, given the
complexity of the videobuf2 framework and how ill-defined the DMA API
was, and would feel better if such could be avoided in future
communication.

That said, we can revert it on the basis of the implementation issues,
but I feel like we wouldn't get anything by doing so, because as I
said, the design is sane and most of the implementation is fine as
well. Instead. I'd suggest simply removing the use of the attribute
being removed, so that the feature stays no-op until the DMA API
provides a way to implement it or we just migrate videobuf2 to stop
using the DMA API as much as possible, like many drivers in the DRM
subsystem did.

Best regards,
Tomasz
