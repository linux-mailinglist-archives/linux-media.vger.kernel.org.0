I have not looked in any of this for quite a while, but IIRC the plan
was something like that:

The NXP RDC hardware is able to segment the DDR memory into sections
and define access policies for all masters in the system. So for
example for the secure VPU to display controller path you would define
such a section, where only the VPU is able to write and DCSS is able to
read from. CPU or other masters are not allowed to use this section.
This then gets exposed to Linux as a DMA heap. The VPU driver could
then allocate capture buffers from this heap and share them via dma-buf
to the DCSS driver.
Both drivers can live in non-trusted userspace and even the address
allocation for the DMA heap can be done from Linux. Non-trusted Linux
kernel/userspace just has no way to access the buffers directly.

The more interesting question is on the VPU side: how do you make sure
that the capture buffer is located in secure memory when the output
buffer containing the secret bitstream is also in a secure heap? I
guess you need some kind of TEE application to validate those settings,
which means you can't give the non-trusted driver direct MMIO access to
the VPU.

Regards,
Lucas
