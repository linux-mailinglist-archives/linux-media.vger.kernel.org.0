It may not be that small. I'd rather let the compiler decide whether to
inline it or not.

I understand the confusion, maybe we can find a better term that would
be different than "connected". "routed" really sounds weird in this
context.

Intuitively, "all pads that are routed to another pad" doesn't include
the "another pad". I'm not opposed to including the start pad as that's
what the current usage patterns need, but we should then rename the
macro accordingly as its current name is counter-intuitive.

Makes sense, but "start" isn't a good name as we're not starting
anything.
