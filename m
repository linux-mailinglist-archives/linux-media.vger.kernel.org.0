Right, this is the standard device-tree model. Unfortunately the
information about which supplies are needed and the constraints
for those supplies is missing from the ACPI description for the
devices which we are dealing with here.

Daniel Scally tried to solve this by allowing specifying this
in software-firmware-nodes. Which you nacked because those need
separate parsing code in the regulator core.

During that discussion you said that instead we should sinmply
directly pass the regulator_init_data, rather then first
encoding this in device-properties in a swnode and then
decoding those again in the regulator core.

And passing the regulator_init_data is exactly what we are doing
now; and now again this is not what we should be doing ?

Also note that the current solution is exactly what I suggested
we should do during the discussion with Daniel and I even provided
example code and you said absolutely nothing about this!

I'm sorry but I no longer have any clue what it is what you want us to do /
how you want us to solve this.

AFAIK what the current code is doing is exactly what you requested during
the discussion with Daniel.

If this is not to your looking please provide some pseudo code explaining
how you want us to solve this problem instead of the current solution.

And please keep in mind that we *cannot* change the ACPI firmware interfaces
and that whether we like it or not things simply work different in the ACPI
world.

Frankly I'm quit unhappy, angry even about how you are blocking progress
here. You don't like APCI we get it, can we get over that now please?

So far all you seem to be doing is shooting down solutions, then first
being quiet about suggested alternative solutions and then once the
alternative solutions are implemented shoot them down again...

And all that without adding anything constructive. All you have
told us is how things should not be done (according to you).

So fine everything we come up is wrong, please tell us how we should
solve this instead then!

Regards,

Hans
