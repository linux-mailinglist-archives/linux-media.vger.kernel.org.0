I added some code around

/* Check for invalid packet type */
    if (!skb) {
     printk("Check for invalid packet type %x\n", (unsigned int)
(&pkts[i])->type);
     return ERR_PTR(-EILSEQ);
}

I don't know if I did it right or I am reading the packet type
correctly, but the frame reassembly errors are being caught here.
