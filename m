What's the status of this? DMA_BUF_IOCTL_EXPORT_SYNC_FILE would be 
useful for Wayland compositors to wait for client buffers to become 
ready without being prone to getting delayed by later HW access to them, 
so it would be nice to merge that at least (if 
DMA_BUF_IOCTL_IMPORT_SYNC_FILE is still controversial).
