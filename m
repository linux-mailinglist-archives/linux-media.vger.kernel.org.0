Hi Laurent,

The use case here we want is actually the latency. We want to know
what is the most accurate delay the user will feel when the camera
capture the frame to the frame get displayed. So anytime earlier then
the dqbuf should be an improvement here. It would help us know better
of a camera quality.

Regards,
Esker
