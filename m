It's in the subsystem maintainer profile
Documentation/driver-api/media/maintainer-entry-profile.rst

Where of course some exceptions are listed but it's anyway enforced
that "efforts should be made towards staying within 80
characters per line"

    - on strings, as they shouldn't be broken due to line length limits;
    - when a function or variable name need to have a big identifier name,
      which keeps hard to honor the 80 columns limit;
    - on arithmetic expressions, when breaking lines makes them harder to
      read;
    - when they avoid a line to end with an open parenthesis or an open
      bracket.

The debate I mentioned was specifically on the previous version of the
driver where me and Krzysztof shown quite different understanding of
coding style requirements.
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/patch/m3fstfoexa.fsf@t19.piap.pl/

That lead me to submit this
https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/patch/20211013092005.14268-1-jacopo@jmondi.org/
which I never managed to re-send, my bad.
