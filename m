Any of these sensors can be used on non-ACPI-based platforms, or on
ACPI-based platforms where integration has been done right. If it causes
an issue to call this function on those platforms, then this driver
won't work. If it causes no issue, why can't we call it in the I2C core
(or somewhere else) ?

So we only need to take one more step to remove just two lines :-)

This is all caused by Intel messing up their ACPI design badly. It's too
late to point and shame, it won't fix the problem, but I don't want this
to spread through drivers, neither for just those two lines (there are
dozens of sensors that would need the same treatment), nor for what the
next steps would be when someone else will want to add ACPI-specific
code and use this as a precedent. That's why we tried hard with Dan
Scally to isolate all the necessary quirks in a single place instead of
spreading them through drivers, which would have been easier to
implement.

I'd like to hear what Sakari thinks about this.
