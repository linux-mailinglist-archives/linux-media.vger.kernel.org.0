Then just remove it. The code for output remains in the git history so if someone wants to
resurrect that, then that's always possible.

The point is that I don't want to have half-baked output support in mainline.

But what exactly is the problem with getting output to work? Doesn't it just decode
MJPEG frames? (Sorry if you explained it before, it's so long ago that I looked at this
that I forgot the details)

In any case, before the driver can be moved out of staging video output should either
be working or removed. Either is fine, but not the halfway state it is in today.

Regards,

	Hans
