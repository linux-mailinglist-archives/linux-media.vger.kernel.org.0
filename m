I can report that your patch for test_firmware works (applied to current 
master from linus d93a0d4; I get some offsets and had to adjust some 
whitespace for it to apply). With that module (and resume test enabled) 
I get freezes at resume in the same cases that would also cause problems 
with si2168.

I'm testing this on bare metal F34 beta with / on a btrfs. I'm using 
nvidia driver again to make sure the system does not otherwise use any 
firmware from /usr/lib/firmware (confirmed with kernel debug messages 
for firmware_loader). My si2168 is not plugged in.

I tested it with a normal population of files in /usr/lib/firmware , 
without test-firmware.bin and also with a random 1MiB file in place. I 
tested after a reboot so it does not do caching.
With /usr/lib/firmware on a separate ext4 partition I can confirm with 
dmesg that the test_firmware suspend test actually works (does not freeze).
With /usr/lib/firmware on btrfs it fails in both cases (with and without 
the firmware files).
With caching (first suspend with the ext4 partition mounted, then a 
second suspend without) it does not freeze even with the firmware on btrfs.


One further thing I noticed which might be problematic in rare cases:
According to the kernel debug messages, the firmware-loader does not 
attempt to cache the firmware during suspend, if the previous call to 
request_firmware() has failed (file not present; call made during 
previous resume). In my opinion it should attempt to cache the firmware 
on suspend even in this case (If I remember correctly, 
firmware_request_cache also works without the file being present). In 
case some low-memory condition has caused the file system cache to lose 
the information about the file being non-present (or the file has been 
written after the initial attempt and is no longer in the file system 
cache), this might lead to freezes even for well-behaved drivers in case 
they reattempt to do request_firmware() on resume.
If the firmware is found during resume, it is cached on further suspends.
Given how long it took me to narrow down this problem in this (for me) 
reliably reproducible case, something like this happening at random 
would be almost impossible to debug/locate and might actually happen 
frequently in the wild.

This is the core part (everything else is unmounted), I shortened the 
UUIDs. The ext4 mount of course is also unmounted when I want it to 
fail, with it in place it reliably not-fails.

UUID=<1> /                       btrfs   subvol=linux1 0 0
UUID=<2> /usr/lib/firmware       ext4    defaults 1 1
UUID=<1> /home/lukas             btrfs   subvol=linux1-f34-lukas 0 0
tmpfs /home/lukas/.cache tmpfs size=16g,gid=lukas,uid=lukas,mode=700 0 0

> Also, how long do you stay in the boot before you try to suspend?

During my reproduction sessions usually only shortly 1-5min, but I think 
I have seen this also after a slightly longer time. I can try to let it 
sit for longer if you think that is important.

Did you also try to create a random test-firmware.bin (I used 1M from 
/dev/urandom) instead of an empty /lib/firmware ?
If the directory is completely empty, it also does not freeze for me. If 
the directory is empty, any attempt to access its content can likely be 
directly served from cache, even if the actual directory has never been 
accessed before, as long as /lib (which is a symlink to /usr/lib on 
fedora) has been accessed (which will likely always be true). So I have 
to further add to my previous findings that "firmware directory is not 
completely empty" is a further prerequisite for it to fail.

The log does not have any entries from resume. For the attempts where it 
freezes the last entry in journalctl is
systemd-sleep[5050]: Suspending system...

I can of course not completely rule out some random write (log files or 
similar), but there is definitely no heavy writing going on. I think 
only writes caused by the act of suspending and resuming could cause it 
this reliably. I have seen it also with a completely isolated btrfs file 
system for /usr/lib/firmware, where there should not have been any 
writes. For ext4 (which is also journaling) it works properly.

I will try to be a little bit more insistent this time. Is "just repost" 
the usual way to handle if patches are ignored?
