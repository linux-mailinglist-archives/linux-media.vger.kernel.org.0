Not really. It will still be a single directory per vendor (whatever
name it is).

Yeah, when some drivers move from one vendor to another one that
already exists there, we should probably move the directories, in
order to keep things well organized.

The worse case scenario is really if, let's say, TI decides to sell their
omap architecture to NXP, keeping the rest. On such case, the best would
be to move platform/ti/omap* to the directory of its newer owner.

That's said, when things like that happen, there are usually a change
at MAINTAINERS, as e-mails, mailing lists and contact people will
likely change. So, this will very likely generate patches anyway.

I'm not too concerned about the name here, but rather about the
process. Needing to do reorg like this is painful, as it causes=20
all pending work to fail merging against upstream, requiring rebases.
So, we should avoid needing to re-do it by trying our best to avoid
the need of another global change like that in the future.

By organizing entries per vendor, while we may need to do puntual
per-vendor adjustments when they rename and change IP with other
vendors, the global platform Kconfig/Make will contain a single entry
per vendor. I can't foresee any need to change this in the future,
if we take care of keeping the entries there properly sorted.

With regards to naming the per-vendor directory, while I do prefer to have
the  directories named after the vendor, and not after a vendor's nick=20
name, It should also be ok to use a vendor's nick name, provided that=20
such name is meant to be used by all their current and future IP.

Not sure if "sunxi" is actually a vendor's nick name. It sounds
much likely that it is, instead, a brand name that covers their=20
current media-related SoC.=20

Can someone from the vendor shed a light on it?

Thanks,
Mauro
