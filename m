Wouldn't this just be a static allocation of the SRAM then? I believe
the correct way to do this is highlighted in Rob's[0] response. This is
also something we have done in the past[1], but I thought dynamic
allocation was preferred method so that the VPU didn't hog a portion of
SRAM. Seems wasteful in cases where the VPU is not being used.

The device itself has the capability of doing runtime allocation before
any decoder/encoder stream instances are opened. All of these opened
streams will share this one allocated pool, meaning first open stream
allocates and the rest share. Because of this, the goal is to allocate
enough to meet maximum use case of VPU (4K60) or max case supported by
the SoC itself if the SoC is unable to handle 4K60.

Is there preferred method for dynamic SRAM allocation? I understand
point that framerate and resolution are runtime choice, but these
properties are not guaranteed to be known when streams are being opened.

If static SRAM allocation is the correct method to go, then this series
can be ignored and I will add section in device tree and remove check
for parameter in driver as that will now be a bug.
