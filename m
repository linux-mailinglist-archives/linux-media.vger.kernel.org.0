I see two distinct issues here:
1) overlap window: this is really a property of the deserializer and
should be here specified
2) reverse channel amplitude: this depends on the serializer
configuration. we could make this a serializer property and have the
deserializer read it from the remote end,  which, if I'm not
mistaken is a no-go (not sure I recall why, but I refrained to do so
as I recall it was considered bad practice).

This should work by ideally rewriting the deser properties when
loading overlays, or simply configuring the deserializer correctly
depending on which serializer is connected in your system. I don't see
it working differently than any other endpoint property. If you have a
parallel video port configured with an active high vsync polarity and
you want to connect a camera with a low active signal state you should
change you video input port ni your .dts or rewrite it with an overlay
in case of dynamic loading.

The real solution here would be to have operations to call on the
remote to get the bus configuration and act accordingly...

I recently proposed
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-renesas-soc/list/?series=256127
which works on remote pads though, and we have one pad per gmsl
channel, while this should be queried from the device. Yes we can bend
this to interrogate the remote side on the first connected channel and
ignore the pad argument in the callee, but maybe we can do better than
proposing an API and working it around immediately ? :)

Really not someone with any dt overlay experience here, but re-writing
properties of nodes defined in the DTS seems like an intentended
feature of overlays... Is anyone with more experience listenting (says
Jacopo looking at Geert ?)
