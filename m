Most, but not all. Some maintainers take entire set - including DTS -
which is not what we want, because *DTS, as a hardware description, must
be independent of driver changes*. Most notably Greg and netdev folks
grab everything. Keeping it together with driver changes brings
confusion and feeling that there are dependency.

Please don't do this.

Krzysztof
