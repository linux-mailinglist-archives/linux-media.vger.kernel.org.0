Thanks for the pointer, I wasn't aware of that.

Legacy apps that only support /dev/video* will increasingly not work
with mobile, embedded and even laptop devices as the industry is using
raw sensors with ISPs everywhere, requiring libcamera in userspace. In
the meantime, both libcamera and PipeWire provide LD_PRELOAD-able
libraries that emulate V4L2 entirely in userspace on top of the
respective project, for those legacy applications (wrapped in scripts
called libcamerify and pw-v4l2).

It would require some work, as the vcam driver uses a custom API. I
believe that the effort would be better spent on completing PipeWire
support.
