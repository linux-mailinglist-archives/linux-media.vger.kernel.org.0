Yeah, exactly that's the intention here.

Basic idea is to group the fences into the categories of "you always 
need to wait for when doing implicit synchronization" (writers), "you 
only need to wait for them when you want to write to the object" 
(readers) and "ignore them for implicit synchronization".

Yeah, that's exactly why I want to get away from those exclusive/shared 
naming.

For readers/writers I hoped the semantic would be more clear, but that's 
doesn't seems to be the case.

Well documenting it in the end is clearly a good idea, but I don't think 
we should start with that before we actually know what we want to 
implement and how we want to implement it.

Otherwise I would write tons of documentation which can be thrown away 
again in the end because we decided to don't do it this way.
