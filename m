The videobuf2-v4l2.c sits on top of videobuf2-core.c and provides the V4L2
uAPI for the streaming functionality. If you don't want to use the V4L2
uAPI for this, then you would need a videobuf2-alsa.c that provides a
(possibly new) ALSA uAPI. Whether that makes sense is something I cannot
decide.

v4l2-mem2mem.c uses videobuf2-v4l2.c, so if you need a ALSA version, then
you probably need to create an alsa-mem2mem.c (possibly some functionality
can be shared).

It's just a third option, and it can be useful if there is a strong desire
to keep the uAPI for this functionality entirely within the ALSA subsystem,
but you want to reuse the streaming I/O functionality that the videobuf2
core provides.

If the decision is that it is fine to use the V4L2 uAPI for this type
of audio functionality through a /dev/v4l-audioX device, then just ignore
this option and use V4L2.
