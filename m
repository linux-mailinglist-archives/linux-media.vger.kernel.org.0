I can try to comply with this, but I generally don't do it
because hard breaks are difficult to read
on a phone or if I have multiple messages open.
My line widths vary between 40 and 80 characters,
and hard breaks can only cover one width, at the cost of all others.

What I found difficult with this documentation is that it described an algo=
rithm,
and did not describe the basic assumption about the shape of the data.
Here, I tried to give a quick overview of the data structure in the first p=
aragraph.
The second paragraph is just a description of details,
not needed to get a high level idea of the API.

I was generally confused about the "mbus" thing the whole time I used the A=
PI.
That's why I came up with the idea to describe what it's useful for (format=
),
instead of using an abstract "code" which could mean anything.
"mbus code" is not even searchable online much, so it's difficult to make t=
he connection.

"Out of bounds" does not say what the bounds are.
What I wrote is in the context of the incrementing algorithm,
which implies that hitting it means hitting the bound ("no more codes").

>=20
Given that I ran head first into a bug involving repeats (prompting this pa=
tch),
I testify that nothing about it is obvious :)
