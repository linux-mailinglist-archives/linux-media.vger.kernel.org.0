I assume that the "timings" the datasheet refers means the pixel array
sampling rate, which depends on the "crop" rectangle that define
the portion of the pixel array fed to the on-board ISP for processing
(mostly subsampling, as this seems to be a raw sensor ?)

The output frame rate will depend instead on the bus link frequency
and the total image size including blankings (usually configured
through the registers named VTS/HTS on OV sensors?)

The most important requirement is to expose VBLANK and PIXEL_RATE as
they're used calculate the sensor's frame rate. Selection targets are
mostly useful to populate the camera properties (ie the full pixel
array size) and to implement digitial zoom, somewhat and "advanced"
feature, hence they're optional to support.

Thanks
