Yes, it is part of the ISO/IEC 23008-12 (2017). The spec defines Image
grid derivation, where each tile is a separate image and associated with
derived image of type _grid_ which reconstruct all tiles into a single
image for display.

In case that is is part of the spec I don't think we have to do it.
Something more, when each tile is separate image the decoding process
could be done in parallel.

I'm not familiar with userspace implementations so far, but my feeling
is that the userspace should configure that - at least this will give
clients flexibility. References with more information [1] - [5].

AFAIK the decoding part is not doing something special and
reconstructing the whole image from tiles is done by the userspace
client [6].
