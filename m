device_link() should handle this. See mxc_isi_async_notifier_bound() in
drivers/media/platform/nxp/imx8-isi/imx8-isi-core.c.

It would be nice if this could be done in the V4L2 core. I haven't
checked if that's possible.

I'd argue that the bugs are there already, at least for CSI-2 sensors
the use a continuous clock. If you resume streaming on the sensor first,
the clock lane will switch to HS mode before the receiver gets resumed,
and the receiver won't be able to synchronize.

System suspend/resume tends to be badly tested in camera sensor drivers,
so lots of bugs creep in :-(
