The v4l2_m2m_ctx_release() already should wait for the job_timeout_work
completion or for the interrupt fire. Apparently it doesn't work in
yours case. You'll need to debug why v4l job or job_timeout_work is
running after v4l2_m2m_ctx_release(), it shouldn't happen.

The interrupt handler cancels job_timeout_work, you shouldn't need to
flush the work.

Technically, interrupt handler may race with job_timeout_work, but the
timeout is set to 1 second and in practice should be difficult to
trigger the race. The interrupt handler needs to be threaded, it should
use cancel_delayed_work_sync() and check the return value of this function.

We'll need to understand why v4l2_m2m_ctx_release() doesn't work as
expected before thinking about the patch.
