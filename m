Ok then. It seems a bit more likely for people to read patches from a
terminal rather than a phone, but.. ok.

First result searching "mbus code" in kernel.org/doc/html/latest
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/subdev-formats.html

Also:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/userspace-api/media/v4l/subdev-formats.html?highlight=media%20bus%20codes#v4l2-mbus-pixelcode

My understanding is that an mbus (media bus) format represents the
whole frame format (code, sizes, colorspace etc) while the media bus code
is the numerical value that identifies the pixel format as sent on the
bus.

Sorry was not clear from my previous comment.
