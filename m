Hey Alex,

Thanks for taking a look!

So, I thought about this a bit:
My thoughts were going generally in two directions:

1. I create a general struct for an RPS layout and let the
  different hardware blocks fill that struct accordingly during
  initialization, this would enable to get rid of those hard coded
  positions but would make the code a bit more complicated and it doesn't
  seem worth it until we actually have a case where it is different (I
  haven't test on RK3288 so far)

2. Implement a function for each hardware block and decide upon hardware
  detection which function to use, this fits more to general kernel coding
  style and to the manner rkvdec is coded. But this won't get rid of the
  hardcoded positions and tbh the code before did have hard coded
  positions as well and you needed to understand this code block as well:
  ```
  #define REF_PIC_LONG_TERM_L0(i)			PS_FIELD(i * 5, 1)
  #define REF_PIC_IDX_L0(i)			PS_FIELD(1 + (i * 5), 4)
  #define REF_PIC_LONG_TERM_L1(i)			PS_FIELD((i < 5 ? 75 : 132) + (i * 5), 1)
  #define REF_PIC_IDX_L1(i)			PS_FIELD((i < 4 ? 76 : 128) + (i * 5), 4)
  ```
  And it least from my perspective this wasn't clean code either as it is
  not obvious without understanding this bit in detail, how the RPS
  structure looks like.
  I'll try to make the code more self explaining for V2. (will need a bit
  preparation for that as I have to rewrite my bit writer implementation
  as it was requested to be usable for other purposes as well)

That is just the term that I heard the most, so I adopted it, I can use
hardware configuration as well, but the important part for me is that
people understand me.

Thanks for the feedback, you are correct my explanation is a bit lazy
and I will look into calculating the values as an option more seriously.

I'll try it out and maybe already in include it in V2.

Thanks again for your feedback.
