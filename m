If I'm honest this is one of those areas I'm still sketchy on, in 
drivers/media/i2c I see calls to clk_get with clock names like so:


eclk

extclk

mclk

refclk

xclk

xti

xvclk


But those only work if the firmware (I.E. dt) for the device defines 
that name for the clock which means they need to define the dt in a 
particular way.Â  So if I make the int3472-discrete driver (which is sort 
of playing the part of dt here) register the clocks called "xclk" that 
means the drivers all need to have that name too, which breaks the dt 
entries if they weren't originally called that. On the other hand, if 
the driver has no name but relies on device matching it will work for 
both the original dt and also for the int3472-discrete driver's clock


Basically it seems better to me to just let it match by device rather 
than have the names. The only advantage I can see for the names is if a 
device has multiple clocks assigned to it...but there are no instances 
of that in media/i2c.

Er, can you point me to an example?
