Yes, for sure.

My suggestion still holds. Start with this common platform code.
Rather than arguing back and forth, could you please perform an
experiment on the current venus driver and move firmware interface to
subdirs, leaving just the platform / PIL / formats / etc in place?
This will at least allow us to determine whether it is a feasible
concept or not.
