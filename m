I've had some success passing it through the ISP as SRGGB10_1x10, but it does not feel like the right way(tm). ðŸ˜Š I need the raw data with as little processing as possible (though 16b extension would be nice) - any advice?

Hi,
Currently the driver does not support Y10 format. But I think that configuring the isp subdevice with SRGGB10_1x10 should work.
I think it is possible to just add Y10 format to the list of supported formats in rkisp1-isp1.c with identical data as SRGGB10_1x10:

But I don't have a monochrome camera to test it.

Tried to use the rkisp1 driver, but was unable to connect to the rkisp1_mainpath output node, because format negotiation failed; so I ran v4l-compliance next and found that it reports several errors (see attached report).
