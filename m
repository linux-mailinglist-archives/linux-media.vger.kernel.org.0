Fwiw, it's a pet peeve, and not a fundamental object to removing some
loops inside reservation_object. Here, the seqno is being used as a
guide to avoid trying to take the lock if it's been externally modified,
but it would equally work with just a plain trylock + test_rcu.

Better yet would be autopruning, but that suggests a slightly different
data structure an rbtree instead of an array and spinlocked cb_list
manipulation instead of a plain refcount.
