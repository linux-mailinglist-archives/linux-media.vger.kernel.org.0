I have this line in the file:
For more information about manipulating DMABUF objects, see: 
:ref:`dma-buf`.

For the :ref: to work I need a label at the reference point, if I 
understood correctly.

Their I2C ADC will support it, as long as the driver supports the 
dmaengine buffer interface. I can make that explicit, yes.

Alright.
