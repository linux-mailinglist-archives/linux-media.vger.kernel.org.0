security bank.

to look for a trustworthy person whom I will release the money into
his care for business purpose pending when his ordeal is over then you
will release 65% of the total sum to us will 35% will be for you

involved. I will only present you to the bank as the owner of the
deposit and I will hand over the code to you and they will deliver the

not interested.
