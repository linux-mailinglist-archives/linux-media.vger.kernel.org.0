Hi Paul,

Thank you for the patch.

I wanted to say let's name this dma_addr as it's a DMA address, not a
physical address (even if in practice the two will be the same), but the
driver uses phys everywhere. I'll send a patch on top to fix it.

As the registers are named CSI_CSIDMASA_FB1 and CSI_CSIDMASA_FB2, I'd
write FB1 and FB2 instead of fb0 and fb1 above. I'll use that
terminology below.

I'm afraid I can't agree with that statement :-( Imagine the following
scenario.

The hardware is currently capturing to FB2, csi->buf_num is thus 0. A
dummy buffer has been queued to FB1 and programmed in the hardware. A
new buffer is queued to be fast tracked by imx7_csi_fast_track_buffer().

	spin_lock_irqsave(&csi->irqlock, flags);

Here the hardware finishes FB2 and raises the BIT_DMA_TSF_DONE_FB2
interrupt flag. The interrupt handler can't run concurrently, as this
function is holding the lock. The hardware however moves to capturing to
the dummy buffer in FB1 by copying FB1's address into the internal
current address register.

	buf_num = csi->buf_num;

buf_num is still 0.

	if (csi->active_vb2_buf[buf_num] == NULL) {

This condition is true.

		csi->active_vb2_buf[buf_num] = buf;
		imx7_csi_update_buf(csi, phys, buf_num);

The new buffer is stored into active_vb2_buf[0] and programmed in FB1.
This doesn't disturb the hardware as the DMA operation uses the internal
current address register, not the CSI_CSIDMASA_FB1 register.

		ret = 0;
	}

	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&csi->irqlock, flags);

Now the interrupt handler runs, and processes the BIT_DMA_TSF_DONE_FB2.
It sets csi->buf_num to 1, and calls imx7_csi_vb2_buf_done(). The
function completes the FB2 buffer that has just been captured and queues
a new buffer to FB2 (either a dummy buffer, or the next buffer from the
queue if there is one). The hardware now has the FB1 register pointing
to the fast-tracked buffer and the FB2 register pointing to the next
buffer for FB2. The hardware is however capturing to the dummy buffer in
slot FB1.

The hardware finishes FB1. It raises BIT_DMA_TSF_DONE_FB1, the interrupt
handler sets csi->buf_num to 0 and calls imx7_csi_vb2_buf_done(). The
function runs the following code:

	done = csi->active_vb2_buf[csi->buf_num];
	if (done) {

This condition is true as active_vb2_buf[0] contains the fast-tracked
buffer.

		done->vbuf.field = csi->vdev_fmt.field;
		done->vbuf.sequence = csi->frame_sequence;
		vb = &done->vbuf.vb2_buf;
		vb->timestamp = ktime_get_ns();
		vb2_buffer_done(vb, VB2_BUF_STATE_DONE);

The fast-tracked buffer completes, even though the hardware hasn't
written to it.

	}

You can't prevent the race with a spinlock. What you can do, however, is
try by calling imx7_csi_update_buf(), and then check if you have lost by
seing if the interrupt flag has been set in the meantime. If it hasn't,
you've won the race, and fast-tracking succeeded, you can set
active_vb2_buf[] to the new buffer. If the interrupt flag has been
raised, you may or may not have lost the race (you may have programmed
the hardware just before the interrupt flag was set, or just after, you
can't tell which one it is as you can't read back the internal address
register to see if it has been updated with the new address, it's not
exposed to the CPU), so you need to assume you've lost and queue
the buffer through the slow path.

When taking the slow path because the race was lost, you also need to
ensure that the fact that you've programmed the hardware by calling
imx7_csi_update_buf() will not cause any problem (both in the case where
you have really lost the race, and the case where you have won it but
you still think you've lost, as explained above). I think it's fine in
this case, but I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader (i.e. you :-))
to prove it, with an analysis of the flow of operations.

Maybe you could return a bool from imx7_csi_fast_track_buffer() and
write

	if (imx7_csi_fast_track_buffer(csi, buf))
		return;

Up to you.
