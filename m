Subject: [PATCH] media: imx7-media-csi: Add support for fast-tracking queued buffers

The CSI hardware compatible with this driver handles buffers using a
ping-pong mechanism with two sets of destination addresses. Normally,
when an interrupt comes in to signal the completion of one buffer, say
FB0, it assigns the next buffer in the queue to the next FB0, and the
hardware starts to capture into FB1 in the meantime.

In a buffer underrun situation, in the above example without loss of
generality, if a new buffer is queued before the interrupt for FB0 comes
in, we can program the buffer into FB1 (which is programmed with a dummy
buffer, as there is a buffer underrun).

This of course races with the interrupt that signals FB0 completion, as
once that interrupt comes in, we are no longer guaranteed that the
programming of FB1 was in time and must assume it was too late. This
race is resolved by locking the programming of FB1. If it came after the
interrupt for FB0, then the variable that is used to determine which FB
to program would have been swapped by the interrupt handler, thus
resolving the race.
