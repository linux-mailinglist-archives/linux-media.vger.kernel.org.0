I just realized that my commit log is wrong.

" ... a wmb() was inserted before the final register write that starts the
encoder. ... " . It is actually before the second-to-last register write.

I see. I do have a Veyron around that I haven't used in awhile. But as you
said, it might not be an obvious hardware limitation.

Unfortunately they didn't leave a whole lot of clues around. For most hardware,
as I mentioned in the commit log, I think the final non-relaxed write should
suffice. I'd point to the decoder drivers not having any barriers or
non-relaxed writes except the final one, but IIUC they are actually two
distinct pieces of hardware.

I suspect we will never know. This JPEG encoder doesn't seem to get used
a lot. The VP8 and H.264 encoders on ChromeOS work correctly without the
extra barrier and get tested a lot, but that's only testing the RK3399.

Hans, would it be possible for you to skip this patch and pick the rest?
Or would you like me to resent without this one?


Thanks
