SVC case is the one I mention in the talk, although the major problem

I know a few decoders in the market didn't implement such feature in the 
its hardware, they rely on the other hardware.

Actually, it would be better to let NPU do such job.

Hiding internal buffer is the worst case, frame buffer could be large.

The current stateless API won't support DMA buffer for the metadata.

How do two cores work parallel? Tiles ?

But AV1 could do intra block copy.

This model sounds easy,

LAT produces partial frame buffer with intra blocks and its motion 
vector buffer

CORE complete the frame from the motion vector buffer and its reference 
buffers

We just separately two hardware devices here.

This sounds be more complex than MTK's case. It would be hard to measure 
the job length with entropy part and inter construction part.

Although usually the later one would consume more memory bandwidth or 
hardware time.
