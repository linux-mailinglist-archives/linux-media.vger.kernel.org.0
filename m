That's not quite what I said:

"Another thing I discovered is that for PAL the vcr_hack control has to be enabled,
otherwise the video is full of glitches. This was present before your series, and
happens even with a video signal from a proper PAL video generator, so this is really
strange. I can't remember that I needed this in the past, but it has been years
since I last tested it.

PAL capture is fine for Top/Bottom/Alternate settings, it only fails for Interlaced
and Sequential Top/Bottom capture modes."

This issue was present before your series, so this is not something that should be
changed in a vb2 conversion, since this has nothing to do with it.

In addition, it is a PAL only issue, and this change would turn on vcr_hack for NTSC
as well, and also for FIELD_ALTERNATE, even though that is not affected by it.

Interestingly, since I was wondering why Christian didn't see it even though he is
in a PAL country, I tested with tvtime and that displays it fine, but qv4l2/qvidcap
show the glitches. This suggests that it is a problem in those utils, and not in the
driver. I'll dig deeper into this.

In the meantime, I'll prepare a patch reverting this change for v6.6.

	Hans
