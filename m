Whether you use regulator@0 or regulator-0, you have the same chances of
clash.

None of this was explained in the device description or property field.
I probably judged to fast but it just looked like duplicated property.
Then shouldn't it have two ports, even if camera side is not visible for
the Linux?

And how does the property support multiple sensors? What if they data
lanes are also different between each other?
