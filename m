The media subsystem is also centered around real time. Without real
time, you can't have a decent video conference system. Having
mem2mem transfers actually help reducing real time delays, as it 
avoids extra latency due to CPU congestion and/or data transfers
from/to userspace.

I don't think maintainer overload is the issue here. The main
point is to avoid a fork at the audio uAPI, plus the burden
of re-inventing the wheel with new codes for audio formats,
new documentation for them, etc.
