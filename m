I noticed that my test app didn't work at all with this, and I also 
wasn't able to use v4l2-ctl to set the format.

At least for my test app the problem was that this driver doesn't 
initialize the format at all. My app first calls VIDIOC_G_FMT with 
v4l2_format.type == V4L2_BUF_TYPE_VIDEO_CAPTURE, then after the call 
modifies the fields it wants to change and calls VIDIOC_S_FMT. This 
failed, as G_FMT returned uninitialized fmt, i.e. type was 0, which my 
app didn't set again.

I believe the driver should have an initial format, something that it 
will accept if an app calls G_FMT and then S_FMT.
