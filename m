The start_streaming op is called when streamon is called and if there are
sufficient buffers (>= q->min_buffers_needed). If there are insufficient
buffers at streamon time, then start_streaming is only called when the number
of queued buffers reaches the minimum.

vb2 has three different state checks that you can use:

vb2_is_busy() is true if buffers are allocated. Typically this means that you
can no longer do format changes or anything that might change the buffer
sizes or layout.

vb2_is_streaming() is true if streamon was called. If this is true, then vb2_is_busy()
is also true.

And finally vb2_start_streaming_called() is true if the start_streaming op
was called (i.e. DMA is in progress). If this is true, then vb2_is_streaming is
also true.

Basically vb2_is_streaming() reports the streaming state that userspace sees,
while vb2_start_streaming_called() reports the internal DMA streaming state.

The confusion is probably that you were using vb2_is_streaming instead of
vb2_start_streaming_called.

Right. And instead check vb2_is_busy().

I actually think that this is something that would fail with v4l2-compliance.

Do you still run v4l2-compliance?

Probably wise.
