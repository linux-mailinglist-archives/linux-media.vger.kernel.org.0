Beautiful!

OK I was not able to reproduce but the details below also clarify why,
so I now was able to reproduce! So I don't need to specifically test
with this distro, but others may do so.

OK thanks for confirming!

Correct, the goal with this test was to purposely *not* call for the
firmware prior to suspend, and instead *race* (do the wrong thing) at
resume. It shouldn't really stall... fail yes, but stall, that seems
fishy.

Yes, that is the *proper* way to do use the firmware API, but we want to
reproduce the stall, and so we have to recreate the issue you reported
by doing something bad.

Right.

OK thanks for the report!

No, I was looking to see how easy it is to reproduce right after a
fresh boot, now that I can reproduce I confirm it happens right away.

No, right now I want to to just focus on fixing the stall you saw.

This is a very important piece of information, thanks!

Indeed, that helps!

So creating say 1000 random files in /lib/firmware on a freshly created
btrfs partition helps reproduce:

mkfs.btrfs /dev/whatever
mount /dev/wahtever /lib/firmware
# Put it on /etc/fstab too

Generate 1000 random files on it:

```
for n in {1..1000}; do                                                          
    dd if=/dev/urandom of=/lib/firmware/file$( printf %03d "$n" ).bin bs=1 count=$((RANDOM + 1024 ))
done  
```

Then reboot, upon reboot do:

modprobe test_firmware
echo 1 > /sys/devices/virtual/misc/test_firmware/config_enable_resume_test
systemctl suspend

If its a guest wake it up:

virsh dompmwakeup domidofguest

Nope, no writes are going on.

You can repost, v2 just add my reviewed-by. Those patches are indeed
correct as they are calling for the firmware prior to resume. Maybe
clarify that.

But indeed there is also another issue which you reported which needs to
be fixed, and for that thanks so much for you patience! I'll be looking
into this!
