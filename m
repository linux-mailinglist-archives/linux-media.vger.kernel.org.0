Hi Jacopo,

Sorry it took that long. Unfortunately I no longer have much time to
work on this, thus the delays.

These registers are also written in ar0521_set_stream(), isn't it
enough?

They can. It appears, though, that clusters aren't about controls which
can't change independently. Both of the two are written to the hardware
at the same time, which appears to be a valid reason to combine them
into a cluster.
This is similar to the gain/balance controls, and BTW the use of
clusters there was suggested by you.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh, I'd be happy for this control to be R/W. Unfortunately the core
media core enforces R/O. This is only a comment about what the core code
does, currently at least.

Fine, will drop the rest of the debug. In fact, I already dropped the
most useful parts (I2C register access debugging).

Well, I originally used
fwnode_graph_get_next_endpoint(of_fwnode_handle(dev->of_node), NULL).
Sakari suggested I should use the above
fwnode_graph_get_endpoint_by_id().
It could be a good idea to agree on this. Not sure about the difference.

The bulk API doesn't allow for delays between individual supplies, does it?
The delays are mandated by the manufacturer.

Right, I will remove the first one.

Depends on the hw, but the power could be disabled, yes.

It does, when the PM is enabled.

Should the above code be changed?

You are right again.

That said, I wonder if it would be better (like easier) to have this
driver added to the staging area instead.
