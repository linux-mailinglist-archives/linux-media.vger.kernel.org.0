I expect that for stateless encoders support for read-only requests will be needed:

https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/project/linux-media/list/?series=5647

I worked on that in the past together with dynamic control arrays. The dynamic
array part was merged, but the read-only request part wasn't (there was never a
driver that actually needed it).

I don't know if that series still applies, but if there is a need for it then I
can rebase it and post an RFCv3.
