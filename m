This series adds new drivers for multiple Maxim GMSL2 and GMSL3 devices,
replacing the few GMSL2 drivers already in upstream, and introducing a
common framework that can be used to implement such GMSL chips, which
avoids code duplication while also adding support for previously
unsupported features.

While the normally acceptable and polite way would be to extend the
current mainline drivers, the choice was made here to add a totally new
set of drivers. The current drivers support only a small subset of the
possible features, and only a few devices, so the end result after
extending them would in any case be essentially fully rewritten, new
drivers.

This series depends on support for internal pads, for which a patch has
been added.

The previous version is at:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250718152500.2656391-1-demonsingur@gmail.com/

Since the previous series, Cosmin has left Analog Devices.
Because included changes from previous version are trivial, his sign-off
and tags were retained.

The following deserializers are supported:
* MAX96712 (already exists in staging)
* MAX96714 (already exists)
* MAX96714F (already exists)
* MAX96714R (GMSL2)
* MAX96716 (GMSL2)
* MAX96724 (already exists as part of existing MAX96712 driver)
* MAX96724F (GMSL2)
* MAX96724R (GMSL2)
* MAX9296A (GMSL2)
* MAX96792A (GMSL3)

The following serializers are supported:
* MAX96717 (already exists)
* MAX9295A (GMSL2)
* MAX96793 (GMSL3)

The following list enumerates new features that are supported by the
common framework and their respective chip-specific drivers:
* Full Streams API support. Most deserializers have support for more
than one link, and more than one PHY. Streams support allows
configuration of routing between these links and PHYs.

* .get_frame_desc() support. Both the serializers and deserializers
implement this to query and provide frame descriptor data. This is
used in features explained in-depth below.

* .get_mbus_config() support. The deserializers implement this to allow
upstream devices to query the link frequency of its pads.

* Address translation with I2C ATR for the serializers.

* I2C ATR translation - some deserializers cannot do muxing since I2C
communication channel masking is not available per-link, and the only
other way to select links is to turn them off, causing link resets.
For such cases, I2C ATR is used to change the address of the
serializers at probe time.

* Automatic GMSL link version negotiation between GMSL3, GMSL2 6Gbps, GMSL2
3Gbps.

* Automatic stream id selection for deserializers which need serializers to
stream on unique stream ids.

* Automatic VC remapping on the deserializers. VCs are picked so that
if they were unique on the sink pad, they will end up as unique on
the source pad they are routed to too, prioritizing using the same
VC ID as the sink pad, to facilitate the possibility of using tunnel
mode.

* Automatic pixel mode / tunnel mode selection. Tunnel mode is used
when VC IDs do not need to be changed and all hardware supports
tunnel mode, otherwise, pixel mode is used. The serializers are
automatically switched between the two by using a private API.

* Automatic double mode selection. In pixel mode, double mode can be
used to pack two pixels into a single data unit, optimizing bandwidth
usage. The serializers are automatically set up to support the double
modes determined by the deserializers using a private API.

* Automatic data padding. In pixel mode, if the data being transferred
uses two different BPPs, data needs to be padded. The serializers
automatically set this up depending on the configured double mode
settings and incoming data types.

* Logging. Both the deserializers and serializers implement the V4L2
.log_status() ops to allow debugging of the internal state and
important chip status registers.

* PHY modes. Deserializer chips commonly have more than a single PHY.
The firmware ports are parsed to determine the modes in which to
configure the PHYs (2x4, 4x2, 1x4+2x2, 2x2+1x4, and variations using
fewer lanes).

* Serializer pinctrl. Serializers implement pinctrl to allow setting
configs which would otherwise be inaccessible through GPIO: TX/RX via
GMSL link, pull-up & pull-down (with strength), open-drain &
push-pull, slew rate, RCLK pin selection.

* TPG with selectable formats, resolutions and framerates for both
serializers and deserializers.

The drivers have been tested on the following hardware combinations, but
further testing is welcome to ensure no / minimal breakage:
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX9296A + 2xMAX96717 + 2xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96714 + 1xMAX96717 + 1xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96716A + 2xMAX96717 + 2xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96712 + 4xMAX96717 + 4xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96724 + 4xMAX96717 + 4xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96792A + 1xMAX96793 + 1xMAX96717 + 2xIMX219
* Raspberry Pi 5 + MAX96792A + 2xMAX96717 + 2xIMX219
* Renesas V4H + MAX96712 + 2xMAX96717 + 2xIMX219

Analog Devices is taking responsibility for the maintenance of these
drivers and common framework, and plans to add support for new
broad-market chips on top of them.

Special thanks go to Tomi Valkeinen <
tomi.valkeinen+renesas@ideasonboard.com>
for testing the drivers, helping debug and coming up with ideas /
implementations for various features.

The following v4l2-compliance test still fails:
                fail: v4l2-test-subdevs.cpp(371): fmt.code == 0 || fmt.code == ~0U
                fail: v4l2-test-subdevs.cpp(418): checkMBusFrameFmt(node, fmt.format)
        test Active VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G/S_FMT: FAIL

As the serializers and deserializers are format agnostic and the values
set are not used to configure anything in the chips, this test does not
make much sense in this context. If needed, a check for the specific ~0U
value can be added.
