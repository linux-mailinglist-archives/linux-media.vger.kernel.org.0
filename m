Your comments are valid. The platform driver piece and some other pieces 
still are common between venus and iris despite this initial effort of 
moving common pieces out. I have also seen this from whatever I have 
reviewed.

Video team also acknowledges this part and internally I think they did 
evaluate this option and their feedback was, the more and more they 
changed, they were touching pretty much every file of venus.

The missing piece i think in all this discussion is that in addition to 
the forward channel, the reverse channel of HFI, based on which the rest 
of the video state machine changes should also be considered.

So even with respect to the code layout, its not just the forward 
communication but the backwards communication of fw--->hfi--->codec is 
becoming a challenge as the venus layers seem to only work with the hfi 
of venus.

For adding support for the new HFI events/communication, it was getting 
harder to extend venus.

What I certainly acknowledge is now with iris whether this can be dealt 
with better for future chipsets to avoid another re-write for another 
HFI as that will be too much of maintenance cost.

I will let the video team comment on this part.

Thanks

Abhinav
