From my point of view, this would fully cover my concern. To clarify this
concern, the  decryption into secure memory currently only ever take place =
in
proprietary code that implements the protection (Widewine CDM). With clear =
key,
we can have an open source CDM (made for testing purpose) so that we don't =
have
to have hidden code to test the entire pipeline. So appart from the TEE
firmware, which is just a firmware like all the others, we could have open
source tests in kernelCI and other CI, and we could extend these test to
eventually support other vendors.

Note that currently, with other proposal, one could allocate and fill a nor=
mal
buffer, and "secure" that buffer to test the CODECs and display, but on thi=
s
specific architecture, with the limitation on the number of secure regions,=
 this
feature isn't available.

Alternatives to this end-to-end solution, we could consider a TA (Trusted
Application) that simply copy data from a untrusted chunk of memory into a
trusted chunk of memory. That seems like a cross-platform solution. It woul=
d be
even better if this get standardized in TEEs for course (or at least requir=
ed
with all secure memory implementation). Then copying from untrusted to trus=
ted
could easily become an ioctl generic to all TEE drivers. That to me would b=
e
equally acceptable, and perhaps easier to use.
