Hm, why can't it be multiple PCM instances instead?

This could be done by enforcing the full duplex and linking the both
PCM streams, I suppose.

Doesn't V4L2 handle the overrun/underrun at all?  Also, no resume
support?

Pause and resume are optional in ALSA frame work, you don't need to
implement them unless you want/need.

Honestly speaking, I don't mind much whether it's implemented in V2L4
or not -- at least for the kernel part, we can reorganize / refactor
things internally.  But, the biggest remaining question to me is
whether this user-space interface is the most suitable one.  Is it
well defined, usable and maintained for the audio applications?  Or
is it meant to be a stop-gap for a specific use case?
