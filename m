I don't have any experience on v4l2src recently but I can comment on the
omap3isp driver.

In general, the format the omap3isp may produce on a given video node
depends on the format of data which the block associated with the video
node is fed with.

For instance, in case of the raw Bayer formats, the pixel order does not
change, and thus the pixel order remains all the way from the sensor to the
video node.

This also means that there is no way to provide an enumeration of supported
formats without knowing the media bus format. There have been proposals to
support ENUM_FMT in such cases by providing the source media bus format,
but those proposals haven't materialised into patches.

So for now, the format needs to be simply set using S_FMT.
