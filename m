I think it's shipped in Chrome Books. Sakari can confirm.

As long as the Windows drivers don't use the ACPI data that Linux uses,
you can be 100% sure it will be wrong. That will never be fixed if Intel
doesn't address the issue on their side, and effort we would put in
standardizing that data for machines shipped by Windows OEMs is a waste
of time in my opinion. Our only option, given Intel's failure, is to
keep reverse-engineering camera support per machine for the time being
(sometimes with the help of OEMs).
