I agree with both Sebastian and Hans here: media devices always had
audio streams, even on old PCI analog TV devices like bttv. There
are even some devices like the ones based on usb em28xx that contains
an AC97 chip on it. The decision was always to have audio supported by
ALSA APIs/subsystem, as otherwise we'll end duplicating code and 
reinventing the wheel with new incompatible APIs for audio in and outside
media, creating unneeded complexity, which will end being reflected on
userspace as well.

So, IMO it makes a lot more sense to place audio codecs and processor
blocks inside ALSA, probably as part of ALSA SOF, if possible.

Hans suggestion of forking v4l2-mem2mem.c on ALSA seems a good
starting point. Also, moving the DRM mem2mem functionality to a 
core library that could be re-used by the three subsystems sounds
a good idea, but I suspect that a change like that could be more
time-consuming.

Mauro
