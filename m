It was actually earlier in this thread, see here for example:

	http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linux-tegra/patch/20200520095148.10995=
-1-dinghao.liu@zju.edu.cn/#2438776

Now, I don't know more than you do, but it sounds to me like there are
multiple valid ways that we can use to drop the runtime PM reference and
whatever we choose to do in this new function may not always be the
right thing.

I think we could probably get it to at least a 3 or a 4 on that list if
we add a bit of documentation and fix all existing users.

Yes, 7 would be better than that, but I think we have to weigh the cost
of the added fragmentation versus the benefits that it gives us.

In my experience this stuff is often copy/pasted, so once we fix up all
of the bugs (and perhaps even add a coccinelle script) we shoudl be
seeing less bugs added all the time.

That said, I'm not opposed to adding a new function if we can make it
actually result in an overall improvement. What I'd hate to do is add a
new API that we all think is superior but then ends up not being usable
in half of the cases.

I think this is something we can likely solve through education and
documentation. Runtime PM is still a fairly new topic that not a lot of
people have experience with (at least if I extrapolate from the many
issues I've run into lately related to runtime PM), so I think it just
takes time for everyone to catch up. This looks similar to me to how we
used to have every allocation failure print out an error, even though
the allocator already complains pretty loudly when things go wrong. Now
we've removed most (if not all) of the redundant error messages and it's
become common knowledge among most maintainers, so new instances
typically get caught during review.

But again, if you can come up with a good alternative that works for the
majority of cases I think that would also be fine. Getting things right
without actually knowing any of the background is obviously better than
having to actually educate people. =3D)
