That would be an amazing catch, you might have seen a lot of:

  x =3D !!(var & 0xf0)

For branches, it does no matter, but if you use x it like this dpb_valid
variable is used, not having 0 or 1 can lead to very surprising results. In=
 the
end its used like this

  set_reg(reg0, val | (x << N))

So using bool type can hint the analyzer that 0 or 1 was likely expected, w=
hile
currently an u8 would be ambiguous and lead to false positive if we were to
warn.
