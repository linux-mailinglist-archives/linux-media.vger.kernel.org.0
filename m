Oh I see, set_stream() sets gains and then calls write_mode() which
handles blankings, exposure and test pattern so yes, all controls seem
to be covered. It's usually safer to go through the control handler
to make sure that any control that is added later is not left behind.
But for now it's all right!

Is there a reason to write them to hw at the same time ? :)

I don't think it's strictly necessary to clusterize them, but
defintely not a big deal

You right, the core does that for you

Let's stick with what Sakari suggested.

Ack then, no bulk API

As it doesn't seem to me you access registers during probe (to
identify the sensor in example) there's no need to power up the device
during probe, but should be enough to let runtime_pm do so when
requested.

Personally I don't think this driver qualifies for staging, it can
be accepted in this form and be eventually changed on top in
drivers/media. Let's see what maintainers think.

I'll review the last version and hope to see this merged soon.
