Sensor drivers do; sensors themselves support much, much more than most
drivers allow. But this is due to the nature of information available to
the sensor driver developers, not really something that is trivial to
change.

I've suggested earlier that the crop and compose selection targets to be
used to convey the cropping and binning (or scaling) that is done on the
sensor, in that order. In reality, there are usually more than one
(sometimes three) inside a sensor to crop, and often more than one place to
scale as well. So the driver would need to accommodate this.

The modes come with both cropping and scaling configuration, and V4L2 only
allows specifying one at a time. In principle an output size may be
achieved by scaling and cropping by different amounts, and as most drivers
use only the output format (size) in mode selection, the result could be
ambiguous. In practice this hasn't been an actual issue.

Better sensor drivers (such as smiapp) do not have this problem as the
configurations (cropping in three different places as well as binning and
scaling) can be all independently configured. So with some luck this
problem could disappear in time with newer hardware and better hardware
documentation.

I have no objections to providing the cropping and scaling information to
the user space using the selection rectangles, albeit it's somewhat against
the semantics currently. This approach would also require using compose
rectangles on the source pads which is not supported (documentation-wise)
at the moment, but it's better that way: it can be added now. There are
other, older, drivers such as omap3isp that configure scaling based on the
source format configuration only.

Perhaps a new selection flag telling the selection is read-only?
