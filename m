Hi Nikita,

Thank you for the v2,

aha, I seem to have a long mail to you stuck in my drafts that didn't
make it out to reply to your last mail. I'm sorry about that, but it
looks like we're progressing anyway.

But in that draft, I agreed that yes, we have catch 22 around setting
that ->info, as we need to power up to determine the specific model.

Thankyou, at least being a separate function makes it a bit cleaner and
clear that it's not specifically a part of probe() but something we act
upon to clean up.

Yes, well I think this is adding the safety by re-asserting our
assumptions on probe time. Which sounds like a good thing given the
circumstances.
