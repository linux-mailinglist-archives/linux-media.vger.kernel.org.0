According to our HW engineers, this is properly documented. I do not 
have the full insight to the "signal parameters" topic, so my answers 
here will be just some kind of "free" translation of what I got. The 
justification here was, that the vsync gap length (in our case/HW) 
represents something slightly different than you may think.

According to our HW engineers, those values are independent.

Should really have been pixels, fixed in v9.

There are everywhere default values, i.e. no uninitialized values exist 
in the mgb4 driver like in v4l2. I have extended the documentation and 
added the defaults where applicable in v9.
