This depends on the distribution. On Debian-like distributions, to
enable multi-arch support, an arch-specific directory is used. Debian
adds it to ld.so.conf (for both /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib). On other
distributions, /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 will be used by meson.

The default is debug, so it includes debug (and no optimization). This
can be overridden at the project level with

default_options : ['buildtype=debugoptimized']

in the project() function.
