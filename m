usb_buffer_dmasync_sg(), usb_buffer_map(), usb_buffer_dmasync() and usb_buffer_unmap() are all disabled
by #if 0 in include/usb/usb.h

usb_buffer_map_sg() and usb_buffer_unmap_sg() are just declaration without definition.

I thought that is what hcd_buffer_alloc() does.

Besides my answer to first question, I found no code use them today.
