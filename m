Do you think context and seqno are not enough for those tools and they 
actually rely on the names? It would sound weird if they decided to 
index anything on the names which are non-standardised between drivers, 
but I guess anything is possible.

Another alternative is to make this tracepoint access the names 
directly. It is under the lock so guaranteed not to get freed with 
drivers which will be made compliant with the documented rules.
