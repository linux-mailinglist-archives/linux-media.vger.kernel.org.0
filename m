In practice such communication issues are rare and trying an I²C access
isn't expensive. The patch does solve two practical issues, namely
correctly probing a driver and making it possible to build more things as
modules.

That said, I agree with with you that ideally a driver would know whether a
device has been fully powered up or not. There could also be adverse side
effects as there have been no such checks previously.
