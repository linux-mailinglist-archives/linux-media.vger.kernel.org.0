OK that is SI2168_B40_FIRMWARE and the driver in question is part of
drivers/media/dvb-frontends/si2168.c, its a 1 file driver so si2168
is the respective driver.

But the firmware is supposed to go be cached in RAM prior to suspend,
given this driver uses the request_firmware() call, only the async call
request_firmware_nowait() lets you opt-out of the cache, and likewise
with request_firmware_into_buf() you don't use the cache.

Note that some drivers implement their own caching mechanism as well,
like iwlwifi, and so don't need this cache.

Please refer to:

https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/firmware/firmware_cache.html

If the nouveau driver doesn't yet have proper suspend working, my guess
is that the issue is the dependency on resources by nvidia ont he dvb
driver, and if suspend may be broken there, ordering on suspend would
not be correct. This is only true is suspend on nouveau is broken and I
don't know the anwer to this.

If suspend is not implemented correctly through the entire pipeline then
your only option is to blacklist the driver. On debian this is what I
use for hibernation blacklisting, this will remove the driver prior to
hibernation:

/etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules

Please debug further with nouveau as that is the only driver we have
control over.

The firmware loader just reads the file directly from the filesystem,
that should complete fine but we can find out more details by you
enabling debugging:

That's the thing, the cache is built out of prior requests. We build the
actual firmware cache through a notifier on fw_pm_notify(), and we build
the cache prior to suspend then with device_cache_fw_images().

So whatever issues you might have during suspend/resume because of
a missing firmware would still be present on this driver because the
driver never called for the firmware. If upon resume the firmware is
requested, we race against the filesystem looking for it and that today
can be racy with any filesystem. That fact that you only see it with
one filesystem can be a one-off, as explained in more detail below.

If the device has been used, so long as the file is still present prior
to suspend, then the cache for it will be created. That explains why
this works.

Can you clarify if you mean then that in this case the dvb device is not
used?

Which driver firmware load fails?

That may because of the dentry cache, and so helping races, doing
something similar as to what the firmware cache does, but in hacky way.

That indeed seems like a good idea in general for dvb that should
probably be generalized, if dvb had a way to get a dvb's driver
firmware name and indeed all dvb drivers are not skipping the firmware
cache today.

That may be the same issue as in b) assuming that you meant you didn't
use the dvb device, and that the firmware load issue is from nouveau.

Are all firmware files used by nouveau upon resume the samea as during
probe? If not using firmware_request_cache() for each of them would be
a good idea to resolve possible races issues.

Which driver? And yes, this is exactly why the firmware cache thing was
done, and its why that for driver that don't use the firmware cache,
they implement their own caching mechanism.

The firmware must be cached prior to suspend.

Try dynamic printk stuff mentioned.

Even though some of the things you say are not clear yet.

Inded, this is just false outdated information and needs to be updated.

For now, this should just be re-written to mention in order to help with
current races against the filesystem (detailed way at the bottom of this
email) being brought up on resume, the firmware API relies on a firmware
cache mechanism, and when that is used it is safe to call the
request_firmware() call on resume. If a driver has not yet requested for
the firmware prior to suspend then the firmware cache will not have the
firmware cached in memory prior to suspend, and so to help with this
firmware_request_cache() can be used.  The call to
firmware_request_cache() can be made on device's probe call.

Some drivers may not want to use the firmware cache though, such as
drivers with large firmware which don't want large firmwares to be
taking so much memory prior to suspend/hibernation, and so certain APIs
allow to skip the firwmare cache. Those drivers must implement their own
solutions to ensure that if the firmware is needed on resume it will
be available or not needed.

> the requested firmware files are residing on a btrfs.

There are two issues here. One is that you are using a driver which
may have resume issues because the driver's firmware is not cached
prior to suspend.

The second issue may indeed be a freeze / issues of reading a filesystem
*while racing to suspend / resume*. This issue can happen with any
journaling filesystem today.

More on this below.

In so far as nouveau is concerned, remove the dvb driver and let's debug
that alone separately, and see if the issue is not related to your dvb
driver first.

Indeed, but then again doing a a race against a filesystem in between
suspend/resume can cause all sorts of issues today, so btrfs is not the
only one with issue there. I had found issue with xfs as well [0]:

[0] https://lwn.net/Articles/735382/

I addressed a topic on this particular issue at LSFFMM in 2018, and here
are the notes from that session:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-fsdevel/20180426212243.GA27853@wotan.suse.de/

I will pick up this work again now, but it will take a bit of time.

Indeed send the patch to use firmware_request_cache() for si2168.

If you still have issues with nouveau, remove the si2168 driver and see
if you can recreate the issue. If not then something between the two
on suspend is likely the issue. But if the issue still persists then
it would seem to be an issue with suspend on nouveau.

The generic filesystem races on suspend/resume are known, and I will
tackle that once I am done with some other task I am completing.
