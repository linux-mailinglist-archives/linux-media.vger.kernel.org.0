I did change that already to mention that you need an mmu notifier,
and that follow_pte_pmd respectively unsafe_follow_pfn are the
alternatives. Do you want more or something else here?

Note that I left the kerneldoc for the nommu.c case unchanged, since
without an mmu all bets are off anyway.

We could pass an mmu notifier to follow_pfn and check that it has a
registration for vma->vm_mm, but that feels like overkill when kvm is
the only legit user for this.

Since at most you get at GFP_MOVEABLE stuff I'm not sure you can use
this to pull the kernel over the table. Maybe best way is if you get a
gpu pagetable somehow into your pfn and then use that to access
abitrary stuff, but there's still an iommu. I think leveraging this is
going to be very tricky, and pretty much has to be device or driver
specific somehow.
