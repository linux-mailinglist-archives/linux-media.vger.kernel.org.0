Yeah, Cedrus is currently the only mainline driver that needs that in order=
 to=20
fully work. I think John used num_entry_point_offsets in his (out of tree) =
RPi=20
HEVC decoding driver too.

Wouldn't be easier to just use u32 directly? This is just array of numbers,=
 so=20
nothing else will be added in that struct...

Anyway, once you add this, I'll quickly update driver to take advantage of =
it.

If I'm not mistaken, HEVC standard actually requires that slice data starts=
 at=20
byte aligned address, so nothing would be lost for correctness of uAPI.

I already had this discussion with John and IIRC conclusion was to have byt=
e=20
aligned value here. John, can you please confirm if my interpretation is=20
correct?
