The discussion should be around the ERROR flag, and not the error state. Er=
ror
state is just an internal thing that have no meaning API wise, but turns ou=
t to
be the only way to get the ERROR flag to be set. With that in mind, this is=
 not
what V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR specification says:

For me "seriously corrupt" and "might have been corrupted" is very differen=
t.

The ERROR flag has been used for many years by the UVC driver to indicate a
partially received image (possibly due to DMA error). That driver went even
further and set the bytesused to the amount of bytes that was received. How=
 this
have been interpreted (mostly due to how the spec around ERROR flag is writ=
ten)
in GStreamer is that the buffer contains "some valid" data unless payload s=
ize
is 0.

As explained earlier, the decision to display "some valid" data is not some=
thing
we should decided for our users. This should be left to the application to
decide. Same goes for GStreamer, if a buffer exist but has "some valid data=
", we
have a GST_BUFFER_FLAG_CORRUPTED flag for it. It is then up for the applica=
tion
to drop if needed for the application. I'm pretty sure some stateful decode=
rs
also behaves like this (simply because an error is an error, regardless of =
the
nature of it).

It might be different today, but few years ago, dropping or not dropping wa=
s the
main difference between Apple Facetime (dropping) and the other video strea=
ming
applications. One would freeze, the other would show "some valid data".

If you look at the outcome of a partially corrupted decoded images and the
outcome of a mid-frame DMA error (typically from a camera stream), you'll f=
ind
that these are visually the same. So it is unfair to consider these two err=
or so
different that a new mechanism must be added. In my opinion, adding RO cont=
rols
to signal these corruption only make sense if the hardware can provide deta=
iled
reports of what is corrupted (list/range of macro-blocks, or CTU that are
affected). Then you could measure the level of corruption, but in reality, =
I
doubt there would be a vast usage of this, specially that the report will l=
ikely
be inconsistent due to limited HW support.

Finally, in the bitstream decoder world, including all software decoders I'=
ve
worked with, the decode is a success only if all bits are perfectly decoded=
.
This is the baseline for good vs bad. Userland expected an image, and whate=
ver
happened, in real-time scenario, it must send an image. Sending a corrupted
image, or sending the previously good image remains a decision to be made b=
y
application. As application exist around the implemented mechanism here, I'=
d
prefer to go for that rather then adding a new API.
