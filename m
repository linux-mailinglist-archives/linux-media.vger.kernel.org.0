Ah, I don't think I have ever seen anyone use buf_finish in that way!

Very inventive, and perfectly legal. Actually a very nice idea!

So, with that in mind there are still some things that need to change.

First of all, you can drop the 'VOLATILE' flag from the control, instead
just call v4l2_ctrl_s_ctrl() from buf_finish() to update the control.
And in stop_streaming the control value should probably be set to 0.

The use of volatile for a control is a last resort, and in this case it
is not volatile at all.

Secondly, this behavior has to be documented: in buf_finish add a comment
along the lines of: "This callback is called when the buffer is dequeued,
so update this control with the number of rectangles."

And where the control is defined, refer to buf_finish to explain where it
is set.

Finally the user-facing documentation has to be updated (npcm-video.rst)
to explain this behavior.
