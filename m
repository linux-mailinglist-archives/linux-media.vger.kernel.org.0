Hello Hans,

I'm having hard time convincing myself that the addition of the new IOCTLs is the right approach for us. Helen was adding the new QBUF IOCTLs that supposed to:

1. Support DRM modifiers.
2. Support per-plane dma-buf offsets.
3. Support new features that "are good to have", like 64bit timestamp and unified multi/single planar formats. 

The idea of using DRM modifiers is obsoleted now. Mixing DRM with V4L will be a mess and nobody really needs that feature anymore because there are not that many compressed framebuffer formats needed by V4L drivers.

The dma-buf offsets is the main thing that is really wanted by multiple users and we can support it by extending the current UAPI, which should be the best option IMO. It will be simple to implement and doesn't require much changes form the existing applications.

If we will ever really need to introduce a brand new UAPI, then I think it should be covering more things like deprecating the creation of multiple buffers at once, making buffers independent and reusable, ability to destroy buffer and etc. This will be a lot of work that doesn't worth the effort today since everybody in userspace already adapted to the current state of V4L.

I typed another variant of the patch that extends the struct v4l2_plane with the new buffer offset field and curious what you're thinking about it. It works fine by replacing the data_offset with the new buf_offset in the Tegra decoder driver since it already supports the data_offset which was previously unused because initially I thought that it was about buffer offsets when implemented V4L support for the Tegra driver. If we will agree on this approach then RKISP and MTK should be the next drivers that may get support for the dma-buf offsets.

Or maybe you have good arguments for the addition of new IOCTLs? Other ideas?

Here is the patch in question:

--- >8 ---

Subject: [PATCH] media: videobuf2: Introduce new buf_offset field for dma-buf
 memory planes

Add new optional buf_offset field to struct v4l2_plane of the videdev2
UAPI and support it in the V4L2 core. This new field designates the offset
from the start of a memory plane's dma-buf.

The primary user of this new field are downstream software stacks that
transition to upstream kernel. ChromeOS is one of those stacks and Android
might be the other. The downstream kernel fork of ChromeOS re-uses the
data_offset field for the dma-buf offsets, but data_offset has a different
meaning, and thus, this approach isn't acceptable for the upstream. The
reason why it's needed by ChromeOS is the integration with GPU subsystem
that uses DRM. In some cases there is disagreement between V4L and DRM
drivers on the memory plane offsets, which is difficult to resolve without
overriding the offsets in V4L.

Since not all drivers will support the new buf_offset, the new capability
flag "supports_mem_plane_offset" is added to the struct vb2_queue. Drivers
supporting dma-buf offsets will have to explicitly enable the new capability.

The buf_offset field is meant to be application-specific because there is
no generic way for conveying the h/w requirements to userspace in V4L.

Note that only drivers can validate the dma-buf offsets properly because
of the different h/w alignment requirements. Hence we can't support the
dma-buf offsets handling in the V4L core and it needs to be done within
drivers in the buf_prepare() callback of the vb2_ops.
