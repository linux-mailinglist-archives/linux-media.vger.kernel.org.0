 /* Should ease the (re-)usage of drivers supporting cards with (different)
-   video codecs. The codecs register to this module their functionality,
-   and the processors (masters) can attach to them if they fit.
-
-   The codecs are typically have a "strong" binding to their master - so I
-   don't think it makes sense to have a full blown interfacing as with e.g.
-   i2c. If you have an other opinion, let's discuss & implement it :-)))
-
-   Usage:
-
-   The slave has just to setup the videocodec structure and use two functions:
-   videocodec_register(codecdata);
-   videocodec_unregister(codecdata);
-   The best is just calling them at module (de-)initialisation.
-
-   The master sets up the structure videocodec_master and calls:
-   codecdata=videocodec_attach(master_codecdata);
-   videocodec_detach(codecdata);
-
-   The slave is called during attach/detach via functions setup previously
-   during register. At that time, the master_data pointer is set up
-   and the slave can access any io registers of the master device (in the case
-   the slave is bound to it). Otherwise it doesn't need this functions and
-   therfor they may not be initialized.
-
-   The other functions are just for convenience, as they are for sure used by
-   most/all of the codecs. The last ones may be omitted, too.
-
-   See the structure declaration below for more information and which data has
-   to be set up for the master and the slave.
-
-   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-   The master should have "knowledge" of the slave and vice versa.  So the data
-   structures sent to/from slave via set_data/get_data set_image/get_image are
-   device dependent and vary between MJPEG/MPEG/WAVELET/... devices. (!!!!)

-   ==== master setup ====
-   name -> name of the device structure for reference and debugging
-   master_data ->  data ref. for the master (e.g. the zr36055,57,67)
-   readreg -> ref. to read-fn from register (setup by master, used by slave)
-   writereg -> ref. to write-fn to register (setup by master, used by slave)
-	       this two functions do the lowlevel I/O job
-
-   ==== slave functionality setup ====
-   slave_data -> data ref. for the slave (e.g. the zr36050,60)
-   check -> fn-ref. checks availability of an device, returns -EIO on failure or
-	    the type on success
-	    this makes espcecially sense if a driver module supports more than
-	    one codec which may be quite similar to access, nevertheless it
-	    is good for a first functionality check
-
-   -- main functions you always need for compression/decompression --
-
-   set_mode -> this fn-ref. resets the entire codec, and sets up the mode
-	       with the last defined norm/size (or device default if not
-	       available) - it returns 0 if the mode is possible
-   set_size -> this fn-ref. sets the norm and image size for
-	       compression/decompression (returns 0 on success)
-	       the norm param is defined in videodev2.h (V4L2_STD_*)
-
-   additional setup may be available, too - but the codec should work with
-   some default values even without this
-
-   set_data -> sets device-specific data (tables, quality etc.)
-   get_data -> query device-specific data (tables, quality etc.)
-
-   if the device delivers interrupts, they may be setup/handled here
-   setup_interrupt -> codec irq setup (not needed for 36050/60)
-   handle_interrupt -> codec irq handling (not needed for 36050/60)
-
-   if the device delivers pictures, they may be handled here
-   put_image -> puts image data to the codec (not needed for 36050/60)
-   get_image -> gets image data from the codec (not needed for 36050/60)
-		the calls include frame numbers and flags (even/odd/...)
