I would like to take the chance that I can literally travel there by 
foot and attend. But I'm not someone who would be somehow important for 
linux-media/v4l2. My motivation is to see the people behind v4l2 where 
I'm trying to get our mgb4 driver and talk to them in person what can be 
done (better) from our side to get the driver accepted. So if there is 
not enough space, I'll be fine with being the first one out of the 
"guest list".
