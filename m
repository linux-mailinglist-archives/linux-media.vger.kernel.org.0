Appreciate your time to review the proposal.

To initiate the venus platform migration, iris driver would be enabled with all
SOCs under HFI_V6XX which are currently supported in venus driver. In doing so,
iris driver, posted earlier [1] is being reworked to have cleaner abstraction to
invoke HFI 1.0 protocol (venus variants) and would be applicable for all venus
platforms. With this, remaining platform migration would be done with some
incremental efforts (platform specific handling).
We would like to get help from community and co-work in enabling the migration
for remaining venus platforms in a phased out approach.

Vikash
