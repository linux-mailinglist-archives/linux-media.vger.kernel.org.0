Any queued OUTPUT buffers will be processed and returned to the client until a suitable resume point is found. While looking for a resume point, the decoder should not produce any decoded frames into CAPTURE buffers.

Without going against the spec, you can as of today pop a capture buffer and
mark it done with error. As it has nothing valid in it, I would also set the
payload size to 0.

So I'd say, for every unique input timestamp, that didn't yield a frame
(skipped), pop a capture buffer, copy the timestamp, set the payload size to 0
and set it as done with error.

I'm not sure though if we that we can specify this, as I'm not sure this is
possible with all the existing HW. I must admit, I don't myself had to deal with
that issue as I'm not using a dummy framework. In GStreamer, we take care of
locating the next sync point. So unless there was an error in the framework,
this case does not exist for us.
