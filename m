I will do that in v2

I haven't seen yet any user for these fields but I will create a new control like
#define V4L2_CID_STATELESS_HEVC_ENTRY_POINT	(V4L2_CID_CODEC_STATELESS_BASE + 407)

struct v4l2_ctrl_hevc_entry_point_offset {
	__u32	entry_point_offset_minus1;
};

and add it in the documentation:
``V4L2_CID_STATELESS_HEVC_ENTRY_POINT (struct)``
     Specifies the i-th entry point offset in bytes and is represented by
     offset_len_minus1 plus 1 bits.
     This control is a dynamically sized array. The number of entry point
     offsets is reported by the ``elems`` field.
     This bitstream parameter is defined according to :ref:`hevc`.
     They are described in section 7.4.7.1 "General slice segment header
     semantics" of the specification.

If Cedrus driver is happy with this definition I will keep it like that.
When providing offset in bit is more accurate and any driver can align the value
if needed, the reverse (byte -> bit) isn't possible.
