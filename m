I have not used v4l2-ctl, but I can see yavta works fine. What command 
did you use for setting format via v4l2-ctl?

Right. This is a bug. The question is what should the initial format be? 
It is more or less arbitrary since there is no configuration made yet 
and we don't know what the camera can or will send. So for example, what 
if I use UYVY 640x480? The camera might not support it at all. Is it 
still OK to have it as the default?
