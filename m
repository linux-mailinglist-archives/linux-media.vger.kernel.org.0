It's only 50 lines from v4l2-async, and I don't think the code is uglier
than the rest of the file :-) In general, I prefer implementing tricky
code in the framework and simplifying drivers. I think our goals align
there, the framework should do the right thing by default for the
majority of cases. However, as Niklas pointed out, endpoint matching is
needed for drivers that register multiple subdevs with external
connections (such as the adv742x), and that's exactly why endpoint
matching was added in the first place. I think this needs to be kept.
