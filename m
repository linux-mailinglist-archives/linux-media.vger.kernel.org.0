Hi Joe,

Thank you for the patch, but it doesn't apply.

Please make sure you use the latest edid-decode version from the git repo
(git://linuxtv.org/edid-decode.git).

Ideally I'd like four patches: one for the bug fixes, one for the additions, one
for the changes and one for the minor changes, just as you grouped them below.

It makes it easier to review for me.

The EDIDs can also be added as a separate patch, but if you are not that familiar with git,
then I can do that as well, using your .zip.

BTW, for the 'Use %hhx or %hhu' change: what compiler do you use? I've never seen warnings
for that by the gcc compiler. If you are using gcc, do you specify extra compiler options?

I see that you have one EDID marked as "modified by SwitchResX". Do you have the original
EDID from the display as well? I'm uncertain whether I want to have a 'modified' EDID in
the example EDID dataset. But regardless of that, I would like to have the unmodified version
as well.

I also see for the Acer two versions: 144 mode off/on: what does that mean?

And what's the difference between EDID_ACR_472_6b1_5.bin and EDID_ACR_472_6b1_6.bin? Just a
different input? Same question for the LG.

Regards,

	Hans
