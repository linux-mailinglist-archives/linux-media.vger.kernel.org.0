Yeah, that makes much more sense.

But if I'm not totally mistaken AMD GPUs can't change the CU config on 
the fly.

I mean you could be in the middle of a compute calculation on the CU 
when a 3d job comes in.

So from my perspective I think we could just drop that.

A one line reference to the stuff above should be enough.

Alternatively merge this into the stuff above as well.
