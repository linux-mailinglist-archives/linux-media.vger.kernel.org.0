Great to hear that you now succeeded in reproducing the problem.

I understood that.

Should firmware_request_cache() always be called, or only instead of 
request_firmware() ? In case request_firmware is called on its own, and 
the firmware file is not present, it might still race on the next resume.
request_firmware seems to be meant to include the cache request for the 
next suspend, but it apparently *does not* if firmware loading fails due 
to a missing file. I think this is something that should either be 
changed or properly documented in the API documentation.

This is a second nuance of the stall I saw: The firmware file (in this 
case test-firmware.bin) is present but not in cache.

If you run

ls -lR /lib/firmware > /dev/null

before

systemctl suspend

your reproduction steps will very likely not stall.
If you in addition run

dd if=/dev/urandom of=/lib/firmware/test-firmware.bin bs=1K count=64

during the preparation of /lib/firmware (in addition to or instead of 
your for loop), then it will always stall (as long as the file content 
is not read before suspend).

One stall is happening while the directory content is being listed (to 
find that the file is not present), the second stall is happening while 
actually trying to read the file. Those two stalls likely have the same 
root cause, but it might be different. I just want to make sure you have 
covered all cases.

OK, will do.

Also thank you for your effort.
