Can we flip things around? I.e., instead of saying which devices are
allowed to use the restricted buffer, can we instead say where it's not
allowed to be used? My view has been that by default the contents of the
types of buffers where talking about here is only accessible to things
running on the secure side, i.e, typically S-EL3, S-EL1 and a specific
Trusted Application running in S-EL0. I guess that serves as some kind
of baseline. 

From there, things turns to a more dynamic nature, where firewalls etc,
can be configured to give access to various IPs, blocks and runtimes.

I understand that it's nice to be able to know all this from the Linux
kernel point of view, but does it have to be aware of this? What's the
major drawback if Linux doesn't know about it?
