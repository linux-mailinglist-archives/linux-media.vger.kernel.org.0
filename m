Just read the code  a bit more, and for proc it's impossible. There's
only a single file, and before you mmap it you have to call a few
ioctl to select the right pci resource on that device you want to
mmap. Which includes legacy ioport stuff, and at least for now those
don't get revoked (maybe they should, but I'm looking at iomem here
now). Setting the mapping too early in ->open means that on
architectures which can do ioport as mmaps (not many, but powerpc is
among them) we'd shoot down these mmaps too.

Looking at the code there's the generic implementation, which consults
pci_iobar_pfn. And the only other implementation for sparc looks
similar, they separate iomem vs ioport through different pfn. So I
think this should indeed work.

Hm I think we could just add a i_mapping member to bin_attributes and
let the normal open code set that up for us. That should work.
mmapable binary sysfs file is already a similar special case.
