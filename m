If we require VM_PFNMAP, for ordinary page mappings, we also need to 
disallow COW mappings, since it will not work on architectures that 
don't have CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PTE_SPECIAL, (see the docs for vm_normal_page()).

Also worth noting is the comment inÂ  ttm_bo_mmap_vma_setup() with 
possible performance implications with x86 + PAT + VM_PFNMAP + normal 
pages. That's a very old comment, though, and might not be valid anymore.
