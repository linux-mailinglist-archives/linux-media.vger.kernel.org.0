Hi Hans,
  I've trimmed the iommu list off now, since we've got past them.

Yeh I can believe it; the code I'm using from Alistair (cc'd) checks it
to see if you're losing any if on a bttv.

Alistair has a neat little test setup generating an image stream;
what that seems to be showing for me is that if I run:

   a) xawtv with 'capture' off in parallel with the VBI read, all is
   good

   b) xawtv with 'capture' to 'grab display' in parallel with the VBI
   read, then the VBI read is getting 'extra' frames in it, where they
   start out as being blank extra frames in between valid ones, but then
   seem to contain an old frame at some point.

   So there's something going on.

No rush.
