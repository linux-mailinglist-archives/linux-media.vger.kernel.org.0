Thanks Jagan for adding me to this thread. Adding Dave & Daniel as well.

Indeed, the drivers/accel is the place for Accelerators, mainly for
AI/Deep-Learning accelerators.
We currently have 3 drivers there already.

The accel subsystem is part of the larger drm subsystem. Basically, to
get into accel, you need to integrate your driver with the drm at the
basic level (registering a device, hooking up with the proper
callbacks). ofc the more you use code from drm, the better.
You can take a look at the drivers under accel for some examples on
how to do that.

Could you please describe in a couple of sentences what your
accelerator does, which engines it contains, how you program it. i.e.
Is it a fixed-function device where you write to a couple of registers
to execute workloads, or is it a fully programmable device where you
load compiled code into it (GPU style) ?

For better background on the accel subsystem, please read the following:
https://docs.kernel.org/accel/introduction.html
This introduction also contains links to other important email threads
and to Dave Airlie's BOF summary in LPC2022.

Thanks,
Oded
