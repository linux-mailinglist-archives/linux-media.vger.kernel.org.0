It's needed for v4l2-compliance but won't be useful in practice, so

Each of those will need to be evaluated separately, but I think most
controls are not needed. The first three in the list above are only used
in atomisp_exif_markernote(), which is called to handle the
ATOMISP_IOC_ISP_MARKERNOTE ioctl, to return information about the lens
to userspace. The information can be retrieved by userspace directly
from the lens controller, or from another source (the focal and f-number
are fixed lens properties for most sensors, and are usually stored in a
platform configuration file).

The binning factors are needed by the ISP, and should thus be queried
from the sensor subdev by userspace, and configured on the ISP subdev.

It could be moved to userspace indeed, although I'd prefer keeping it in
the kernel if possible.

There's no meaningful separation between the "atomisp driver" and the
ISP subdev in this case. Both the ISP subdev and the video nodes will be
created by the atomisp driver, the ISP subdev won't be handled by a
separate driver.

It's not about "faking" anything. We should have one or multiple subdevs
in the MC graph to represent the ISP, depending on the device
architecture. I can't advise on how to split the ISP in multiple subdevs
as I don't know enough about the device, but it could be that a single
sudbev with multiple inputs (2x for the sensors, one for memory) and
multiple outputs (to all the video nodes) would work just fine.

If it's static data a custom ioctl would be the easiest option.

For parameters, recent ISP drivers use metadata nodes to pass a large
structure of ISP parameters to the kernel, storing it in buffers.
Possible alternatives are V4L2 controls or custom ioctls, but we'll
likely have to involve the request API in that case, which doesn't
support formats or custom ioctls. I'm not sure that's realistic, a
parameter input video node may be better.

That's not an issue, all ISPs operate that way. The real sensor
resolution should be exposed to userspace, and the ISP input and output
formats (and internal parameters) should be configured by userspace to
take into account the margins that the ISP consumes.

Power control isn't handled by ACPI then ?

The V4L2 core doesn't do that. atomisp_subdev_register_entities() is
called twice, see isp->num_of_streams. The naming is weird, as capture,
viewfinder and preview are different streams, I don't know what the
stream in "num_of_streams" correspond to.
