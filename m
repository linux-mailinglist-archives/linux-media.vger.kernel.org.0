Thank you very much for solving that problem, I've tested the scenarios
described below and it works like a charm. (With your V2)

Actually, I have posted the patch already see here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-media/patch/20210130182313.32903-2-sebastian.fricke@posteo.net/

I currently review the requested changes and questions and will soon
post a second version, but I expect quite some time until it is actually
merged.
