Indeed, the dvb init is called from dvb, so your two patches are good
for now I think.

OK great.. but..

Fedora 32 comes with no firmware at all? Are you sure? How about your
wifi?

Here now you say that if you install either the firmware files for
either si2168 or nouveau can cause a freeze, meanwhile what I wrote
above and you agreed is what you meant, says that the freeze happens
only if you *don't* have the firmware for nouveau present *and* you
also don't have the any other firmware present.

You also clarify here your freeze happens on resume only. Is that right?
Never on suspend, but if the freeze happens, it happens only on resume?

The actual case where you reach a freeze is still not clear yet. Let's
try to clarify this.
