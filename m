OK, that does work for the additional cases I mentioned.  And for
testing...we would still want to use DMABUF_SECURE on both ends for
Mediatek at least (that's the only way they support it). But rather
than having to bother with a clearkey implementation...we can just do
something that directly copies compressed video into the secure
dmabufs and then exercises the whole pipeline from there. This same
thing happens with the 'clear lead' that is sometimes there with
encrypted video (where the first X seconds are unencrypted and then it
switches to encrypted...but you're still using the secure video
pipeline on the unencrypted frames in that case).
