Thank you for the insight.

Focussing on the IPU6, we need two things: an upstream kernel driver,
and corresponding support in the libcamera project (if you're familiar
with the Linux display stack, that would be the equivalent of a DRM
driver and corresponding support in Mesa for a GPU).

The kernel driver likely needs to come first, and there we have two
options. The first one is implementing a V4L2 driver, as that's the
camera API in the Linux kernel today. As mentioned by Sakari, it can be
done, but isn't a great match due to the IPU6 hardware complexity. V4L2
is generally considered as a dead end for recent ISPs, it may still be
able to cover that space for some time, but its days are counted (in
this area only, the API works fine for lots of other use cases).

The second option is to create a better kernel API, and then implement
an IPU6 driver for it. Ideas have been brainstormed for a few years now,
and the Google Chrome OS proposal that was unveiled by Ricardo at the
Kernel Recipes conference in June is one particular embodiment of this.
There is however no consensus on that proposal (that may be the biggest
euphemism I've ever made).
