360Â° cameras come to mind, they can use multiple sensors mounted with
different angles.

Most devices will only need to report a 0, 90, 180 or 270 rotation angle
along an axis perpendicular to the device. For those, mount-matrix is
indeed a bit overkill, and a rotation property would be enough. However,
when we will need to express more than those simple configurations,
mount-matrix will become needed, and all of a sudden we will have
multiple ways to express the same information. That's what I would like
to avoid by going for mount-matrix already.
