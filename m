Right, on my Juno the transition latency (i.e. worse case) is about
1.2ms; I can see that eating into your time budget, depending on the
framerate you're going for.

Vincent's got a point, if you can limit that max-freq-hold to a single
frequency domain, that would probably be a tad better.

Thanks for persisting through my questioning :-)
