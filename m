Hmm, this comes from the first version of this driver where Y_OUT_SIZE
was set to 0x87e (2160 + 14). This in turn comes from the datasheet ('Register
Setting for Each Readout Drive Mode').

Looking at the "Detailed Specification of Each Mode" (page 63 in my copy of
the datasheet) I see three additional parameters: "Front ignore area of
effective pixel", "Front effective margin for color processing" and "Rear
effective margin for color processing", these are 6, 4 and 4, which is a
total of 14.

So I guess that's where the 14 comes from.

Knowing with which bridge driver this was tested will definitely be helpful.
