Sorry for being a bit unclear here. nouveau seems to be working 
perfectly fine for me when it comes to this issue. Not using nouveau 
actually adds one more case in which the system freezes (when no 
firmware files are installed; case e) below). Of course I can not 
completely rule out a different problem with the nouveau driver, but my 
problem seems to be caused by si2168 only.

I will likely not have to do that now with the proper solution I have 
for si2168, but this can come in handy in the future should I hit some 
other suspend problem.

Sure. I only mentioned the nvidia driver because the case "no firmware 
files installed" only seems to freeze the system on resume with the 
nvidia driver but not with nouveau.

I already figured that out (I used "module firmware_class" though).

Yes, indeed. I had confirmed that with the firmware_class debug messages 
enabled.

With "not used" I mean that the device has been recognized, the si2168 
module is loaded and si2168_probe() has been called on the device, but I 
have not started a media player which actually plays a DVB-C stream. 
Therefore si2168_init() has never been called and the firmware has never 
been requested or loaded to the device.

On resume si2168_init() will be called (although I don't think this 
actually is really necessary) and the firmware load of si2168 fails if 
the firmware files are not installed. If the kernel does not already 
know that the files are not present without access to the file system, 
the system just freezes.

This is actually just the inverted case of b).
The only real relevance of the nouveau driver here is that its 
(perfectly working) firmware caching on suspend actually seems to be 
equivalent to manually running "ls" on the firmware directory and 
afterwards the kernel also knows whether or not the si2168 firmware 
files are present without file system access.

I have not compared them one-by-one, but as I have already written, 
nouveau seems fine here.

I have tried that, but in case the system freezes, I have not managed to 
get any useful debug info on the screen. But

I'm very sorry for that. But it always is a compromise between giving 
all possible information and not producing a huge pile of text.

I sent it to the media mailing list (split into two patches).

Nouveau does seem to work (including suspend), except if you actually 
need some decent 3D performance.

Great to know that the underlying cause for the freeze is known and a 
solution is being worked on (or at least planned to be worked on).
