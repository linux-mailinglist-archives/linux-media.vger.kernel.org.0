Dearest Friend,

I am Mohamed Abdullah, I want to seek your assistance after my
discovery during auditing in my bank as I'm the manager of Bill and
Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department in Banque Centrale des
Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) Ouagadougou Burkina Faso.

In my department we discovered a sum of $27.500.000 million in an
account that belonged to one of our foreign customer. Upon maturity,
we sent a routine notifications to his forwarding addresses but got no
response. After some months, we sent a reminder and finally discovered
that our customer died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he did not leave a will and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless, I therefore, i want
to used my position at the Bill and Exchange Manager to have the fund
transferred out of the deceased account to your account, I therefore
made further investigation and discovered that the person did not
declare any next of kin in all his official documents, including his
bank deposit paperwork.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I decided as the head of my
department to make this business proposal to you, to apply for the
money as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement, and you will be given 35% of the total
amount, 60% will be for me and my colleague in my bank, while 5% will
be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of
transferring. We will conclude this operation within 21 banking days
based on the amount of co-operation you will contribute.

You will apply and start the first transfer with Eleven million
[$11,000.000] upon successful transaction without any disappoint from
your side, then you shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining
amount to your account.

upon your positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key bank official who
is deeply involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never,never let me down. With my influence and
the position of the bank official we can transfer this money to any
foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that
this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country
for sharing.

Thank you for your understanding as I await your urgent response in
order to give you more details,


Yours faithfully,
Mohamed Abdullah.
