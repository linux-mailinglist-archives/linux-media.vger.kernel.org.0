My impression was that we documented that should have been a number, but 
I might be wrong on this. And if it's not documented to be a number, I 
think it should be.

The background is that you probably need to associate the DMA-buf with 
some userspace structure for accounting and that becomes easier when you 
can just put them into a radix.
