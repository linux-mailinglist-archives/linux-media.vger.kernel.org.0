Hi Andrey,

sorry for the delay and huge thanks for the effort of adding parallel
support into the driver.

Yeah pushing this driver is still in my todo and your effort for the
parallel part helps me a lot.

Since you already have a commit which adds the parallel support, what
about I prepare the driver with only CSI support for the time being
(after cleanup as you also suggested) and then you can push additionnal
patches on top of it to add parallel support ?

Regards,
Alain
