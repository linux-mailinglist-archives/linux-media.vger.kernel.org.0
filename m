habanalabs is a special case as it was a couple of years already in 
drivers/misc, and therefore didn't use drm mechanisms at all. If we 
would have upstreamed a new driver, the expectation would have been that 
we would use some drm mechanisms.

I think that the minimal requirement is to use GEM/BOs for memory 
management operations. At least I see both qaic and ivpu use it.

ofc, you need to register your device through drm/accel and use the 
sysfs/debugfs drm infra.

If you have device memory that the user can allocate and map, then you 
will also need to use TTM.

I don't think you need to use drm_sched as it is tightly coupled with 
how GPUs work.
