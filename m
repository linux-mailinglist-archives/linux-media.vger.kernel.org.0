Ah, ok. The default regulator_init_data in the tps68470_init[]
array was already there in the out of tree version of this driver
Daniel and I started with:

https://github.com/intel/linux-intel-lts/blob/4.14/base/drivers/regulator/tps68470-regulator.c

Now that you have pointed this out I would be more then happy to
delete it and I agree that providing this bogus data is not a
good idea.

Ok, for the next version of this patch-set I will:

1. Remove the default init_data
2. Change the toplevel comment to be all C++ style matching the SPDX line
3. Add a || COMPILE_TEST to the Kconfig so that this can be compile-tested
   without selecting the INTEL_SKL_INT3472 option

Thank you for taking the time to dive a bit deeper into the patch-set
and make it clear that your objection is the presence of the default
regulator_init_data; and sorry for loosing my cool a bit in my previous
email.

Regards,

Hans
