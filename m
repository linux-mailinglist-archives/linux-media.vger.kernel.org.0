Thanks for the reassurance :) In any case I think there's work to be done
to figure the precise meaning of the feedback data. I remember seeing heade=
rs
that describe the data layout but the meaning of individual fields seems
very vague. But in any case we need proper understanding of that since
that's what the driver will be returning.

Okay I understand your point here. If the expectation is to fully validate
proper use-cases and not just parts of the API individually, I don't object.
It's a high standard but it might prevent issues down the road.
