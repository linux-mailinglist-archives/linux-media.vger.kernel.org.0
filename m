What has been done to help maybe make those apis work properly for this
hardware?  The hardware design pipeline is very long, this isn't
anything new that people just suddenly realized was going to need to
have full support on Linux.

Hardware standardization isn't an issue here, it's having working Linux
code to support all the crazy devices.

Ok, great, what type of api would work for this hardware?  You all have
access to the hardware, know how it works, and know how userspace needs
to consume it.  So why not work to create the needed kernel support for
this now?  What is the causing the delay?
