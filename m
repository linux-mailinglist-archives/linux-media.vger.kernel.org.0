dma-buf doesn't even give you a scatterlist, there's dma-buf which truly
are just handles that are 100% device specific.

It really is the "everything is optional" interface. And yes we've had
endless amounts of fun where importers tried to peek behind the curtain,
largely because scatterlists didn't cleanly separate the dma_addr_t from
the struct page side of things. So I understand Christian's concerns here.

But that doesn't mean we cannot add another interface that does allow
importers to peek behind the curtiain. As long as we don't make a mess and
confuse importers, and ideally have compat functions so that existing
importers can deal with pfn exporters too it's all fine with me.

And I also don't see an issue with reasonable pfn semantics that would
prevent a generic mmap implementation on top of that, so that
dma_buf_mmap() just works for those. The mmu notifier pain is when you
consume mmaps/vma in a generic way, but implementing mmap with the current
dma_resv locking is dead easy. Unless I've missed something nonobvious and
just made a big fool of myself :-)

What we cannot demand is that all existing dma-buf exporters switch over
to the pfn interfaces. But hey it's the everything optional interface, the
only things is guarantees are
- fixed length
- no copying
- refcounting and yay it only took 10 years: consistent locking rules

So I really don't understand Christian's fundamental opposition here.
