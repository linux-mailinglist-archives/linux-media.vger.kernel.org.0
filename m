Right. I thought about doing this but then figured "let's just follow 
what CAL does". Will move them into separate subdirectories.

Ok.

:-(

I'm afraid the documentation has let me down here. There is no clear 
mention about the fact that media controller API replaces the "legacy" 
API. In fact, [0] seems to suggest that the media controller API is 
optional.

  Bridge drivers traditionally expose one or multiple video nodes to 
  userspace, and control subdevices through the v4l2_subdev_ops 
  operations in response to video node operations. This hides the 
  complexity of the underlying hardware from applications. For complex 
  devices, finer-grained control of the device than what the video nodes 
  offer may be required. In those cases, bridge drivers that implement 
  the media controller API may opt for making the subdevice operations 
  directly accessible from userpace.

Anyway, I don't think supporting the legacy API makes much sense since 
this is a new driver. Will convert it to use the MC API. We can always 
add the legacy API support if some application demands it.
