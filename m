Ah yes, this only works if the task you boost is the one that will handle
whatever work you care about (in this case handling the irq). That said, if
you do use threaded IRQs, that should give you a SCHED_FIFO thread, which
should drive the frequency to its max when using schedutil (unrelated to
uclamp).
