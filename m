Correct, only SRC/DST/BG type of blitters can be supported for compositing,
which is quite limiting. Currently there is no way to make an N:1 M2M, as M=
2M
instances are implemented at the video node layer, and not at the MC layer.=
 This
is a entirely new subject and API design space to tackle (same goes for 1:N=
,
like multi scalers, svc decoders etc.).

> 2. AV1 film gain

For AV1/HEVC film grain, it is handle similar to inline converters and scal=
ers.
The driver secretly allocate the reference frames, and post process into th=
e
user visible buffers. It breaks some assumption made by most protected memo=
ry
setup though, as not all allocation is user driven, meaning the decoder nee=
ds to
know if its secure or not. Secure memory is a also another API design space=
 to
tackle.

True, but easy to design around the stateless model. I'm not worried for th=
ese.

I thought that having the kernel schedule ISP reprocessing jobs (which requ=
ires
instances) would be nice. But this can only be solved after we have solved =
the
N:N use cases of m2m (with multiple instances).

On RK3588 at least, decoder scheduling is going to be complex. There is an =
even
number of cores, but when you need to decode 8K, you have to pair two cores
(there is a specific set of cores that are to be paired with). We need a de=
cent
scheduling logic to ensure we don't starve 8K decoding session when there i=
s
multiple smaller resolution session on-going.

On MTK, the entropy decoding (LAT) and the reconstruction (CORE) is split. =
MTK
vcodec is using multiple workqueues to move jobs around, which is clearly
expensive. Also, the life time of a job is not exactly easy to manage.

On RPi HEVC (not upstream yet, but being worked on), the entropy decoding a=
nd
reconstruction is done one the same core, but remains 2 concurrent operatio=
n.
Does not impose a complex scheduling issue, but it raised the need for a wa=
y to
fully utilize such HW.

This is just some examples of complexity for which the current framework is=
 not
that helpful (even though, its not impossible either).
