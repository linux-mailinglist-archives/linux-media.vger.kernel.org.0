yes.

(rate, channel, format) are the basic parameters for audio stream.
For example, if there is decoder/encoder requirement, the rate field is
still needed,  I think the rate shouldn't be removed.

tweak ratio is not always needed by use case. As you said, for
file to file conversion, it is not needed, so keeping 'rate' is necessary.
