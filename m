Thank you for the feedback!

Yes, it's not nice that V4L2_EVENT_XFER_ERROR does not tell userspace
whether an error is recoverable (i.e. the event can be ignored) or not
(i.e. a restart of streaming is required) but the other possible option
would be (as concluded in [3]) to implement a frame timeout monitoring
thread in v4l2 core. I am not sure if it is possible to implement this
second option cleanly...

A a new function vb2_queue_error_with_event() suggested by Hans seems to be
redundant now, since it would not be used by rcar-vin (unless we implement
frame timeout monitoring in the v4l2 core). Or do you have an idea, which
drivers could be the first users of it, e.g. staging/media/imx I mentioned
before?
