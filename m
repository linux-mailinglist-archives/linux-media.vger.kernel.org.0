Hi Jai,

That would be the best option. It's not immediately apparent to me if
the DMA engine API supports such a use case.
dmaengine_prep_interleaved_dma() gives you finer grain control on the
source and destination increments, but I haven't seen a way to instruct
the DMA engine to direct writes to /dev/null (so to speak). Vinod, is
this something that is supported, or could be supported ?

If you implement .device_prep_interleaved_dma() in the DMA engine driver
you could write to a single line buffer, assuming that the hardware would
support so in a generic way.
