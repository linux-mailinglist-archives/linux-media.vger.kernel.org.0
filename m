Thanks for that.

That too.

FWIW, I believe using more than 100 columns or so makes it more
difficult to track quickly and efficiently to the next line.
Reading with multiple visual saccades on a single line is slow.

And IMO:

o reverse xmas tree declarations is quite a poor style requirement
o single line c99 // comments should be encouraged/preferred
o identifiers longer than 20 characters or so should be discouraged
