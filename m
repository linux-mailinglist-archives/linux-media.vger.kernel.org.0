For some context, when I was testing the downstream driver against the
device tree, I saw some failures because of the missing reset ( which I=
 am trying
to add in the first two patches for this series )

...
	hdmirx=5Fdev->rst=5Fbiu =3D devm=5Freset=5Fcontrol=5Fget(hdmirx=5Fdev-=
>dev, "rst=5Fbiu");
	if (IS=5FERR(hdmirx=5Fdev->rst=5Fbiu)) {
		dev=5Ferr(dev, "failed to get rst=5Fbiu control\n");
		return PTR=5FERR(hdmirx=5Fdev->rst=5Fbiu);
	}

Sorry for referring this as a driver build failure but I am sure you wo=
uld=20
also have not been okay with the above issues.
Ofcourse I can simply remove this dependency from the driver but maybe
that will affect the functionality and I didn't want to send a buggy pa=
tch series.

My intention here was just like Heiko said, to keep all the dependent p=
atches
together. I didn't know that would be a trouble for Maintainers.

FWIW, HDMIRX patch series was reviewed multiple times and that is why y=
ou
see a Reviewed-by tag from a Collabora Engineer. Sometimes the things t=
hat look
problematic to one might not look the same to others and that is why I =
asked you
to provide some more details about the problem that you were seeing.

This was my mistake and I simply forgot to remove the DTS when I was
testing the driver for the last time before sending the v3 upstream.
Adding it in the middle was incorrect, I should have added it as a sepa=
rate
patch but honestly this has always been very confusing and the expectat=
ion
differs from maintainers to maintainers.

I will make sure to correct this in my v4.
