Hi Eugen,

Thank you for the patch.

Ports are hardware elements, so in that sense they should exist if the
hardware is synthesized with the port, even when the port isn't
connected. Connections are then described by endpoints. I think both
port@0 and port@1 should be required, and the above description updated
accordingly.
