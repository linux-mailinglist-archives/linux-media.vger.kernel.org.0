There's also a driver for the Vision Components FPGA controller in my
branch. If you would like me to review yours, please CC me when posting
it.

The sensor couldn't be switched while streaming, but you could control
which sensor to use before starting streaming by enabling and disabling
links. An immutable link can never be disabled.

We could create the link as immutable if only once sensor is connected,
which is the usual case. However, I wonder if it wouldn't make things
more difficult for userspace that would need to avoid trying to disable
the link in that case.
