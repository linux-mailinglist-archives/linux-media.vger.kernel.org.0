I would imagine that in most cases, people either have an IOMMU, or they 
don't have more RAM than the device can access directly.

And in fact I think we've missed looking deep enough and that's the real 
problem here - the overall context is a buffer allocator, so if SWIOTLB 
is bouncing anything in that dma_map_sg() call, then it means we're 
allocating a buffer for a device out of pages that that device can't 
actually access, which seems fundamentally bad. Unfortunately there 
isn't currently an easy way to do the right thing - dma-debug would 
probably get very unhappy about scraping a bunch of dma_alloc_pages() 
allocations into a scatterlist and subsequently calling dma_sync_sg() on 
it, while dma_alloc_noncontiguous() does at least return a scatterlist 
but would be overly restrictive since we don't need it to be 
dma-contiguous either. I guess we could do with some sort of 
dma_alloc_sgt() API that joins the relevant internal bits together to 
replace vb2_dma_sg_alloc_compacted() with proper DMA-mask-aware 
allocation, and probably also allocates the sg_table as well?

Thanks,
Robin.
