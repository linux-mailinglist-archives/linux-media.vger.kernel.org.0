I realized that I forgot to mention that attendance is free.

There are a limited number of seats, so should I get more people than there
are seats, then I'll have to make some choices. The primary criteria
is how active you are as media subsystem developer.

That said, do not hesitate to sign up, I don't believe it ever happened
that we had more signups than seats.
