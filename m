No, this is fine, thank you!

OK, good to know.

From the compliance output:

	v4l2-compliance 1.22.1, 32 bits, 32-bit time_t

This is an old v4l2-compliance version. Compile it directly from the
v4l-utils git repo and check the output again.

	Compliance test for atmel_isc_commo device /dev/media0:

As you can see, the driver name is cut off. Isn't 'atmel-isc'
a better name?

I'd like to see this documented in a new
Documentation/admin-guide/media/atmel-isc.rst file. That can be a new patch.
