I agree with everything above.

Here I'm a little confused. Isn't it the opposite according to the 
datasheet?

Setting the register to 0x42 (bit 6 = 1) initiates SW standby, which I 
assume stops all other functions on the chip but still allows 
programming registers.

Then setting 0x02 (bit 6 = 0) exits from SW standby in case of MIPI.

For DVP though, I see that we skip setting 0x02 to that register in 
ov5640_load_regs(), so sensor stays in SW standby mode until 
ov5640_set_stream_dvp() is called.

I don't think we can use the SCCB register pwdn & reset for the initial 
sensor power up sequence, as sensor SCCB depends on the correct sequence 
being followed on hardware pins. From Section 2.8:

	Manually applying a hard reset upon power up is required even
	though on-chip reset is included.

But I agree, if some module does not wire the pins at all then we might 
have to ignore the datasheet here and try it using the register.
