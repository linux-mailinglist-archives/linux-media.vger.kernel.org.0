Sorry for the delayed reply, needed to get some more info. This really
wouldn't be possible due to the limitation on the number of
regions...for example only 32 regions can be defined on some SoCs, and
you'd run out of regions really fast trying to do this. That's why
this is creating heaps for those regions and then allocations are
performed within the defined region is the preferred strategy.
