Oh, I get a dejavu here. I assume this is on an i.MX8QM or i.MX8QXP,
but not one of the other i.MX8 ones. They have a similar name, but are
very (!) diffeent in some aspects.

To answer your question, neither of those two alignments. The RM for
i.MX8QM and i.MX8QXP states:

See also [1]. 

This essentially means, unless you use RAW16, you will get RAW14 with a
different amount of LSB bits set to 0.
IIRC there was some patchset to introduce a RAW14 format ([2]) for
exactly this use cas.
There is also some kind of demo doing post-processing ([3]).

Alexander
