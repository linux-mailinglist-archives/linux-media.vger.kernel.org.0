Hi Sakari,

Thank you for the patch.

That's correct only if the driver powers the device up manually, which
isn't documented here. I recommend adding code examples, and explaining
why this particular initialization sequence is preferred.

A rationale would also be useful.

Unrelated to this patch, but given how many times I've been told to make
drivers developed for OF-based systems ready for ACPI in case anyone
would ever need that, I think we should require DT support for new
sensor drivers even if they're developed on ACPI systems. It's just
unfair otherwise.

This is applicable to all drivers, not just drivers using autosuspend,
and the correct function is pm_runtime_resume_and_get().

Let's not go back there. If pm_runtime_resume_and_get() doesn't provide
the right return value, fix it. I do not want to see a call to any RPM
put function in case the get function fails. That was too error prone,
and that hasn't changed. Fix the RPM API instead. I know it's hard given
the number of users, but that's not an excuse. If it requires the help
of coccinelle, and touching hundreds of drivers in a large tree-wide
patch, so be it. I'm getting tired of the pain inflicted on hundreds, of
not thousands, of driver developers because the RPM API has been badly
designed. This is a hard blocker for me.

This belongs to the probe/remove section above, with a clearer
explanation.

From a driver point of view, I think you should say that some firmware
implementations request the device not to be powered up at probe time,
and explain what the driver needs to do to handle that properly.

Reflowing text without making any other change makes review more
difficult, you may want to split that to another patch (or drop it).

As commented separately in another patch that makes a corresponding
change in a sensor driver, I don't like this. Less complexity in drivers
please, not more.
