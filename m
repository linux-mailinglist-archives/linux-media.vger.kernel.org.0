Fair enough, I just feel like the code should try his best to have as
few hidden details as possible. And in this case our intention is to
disable the entries (removing the active and valid flag) but what we do
is that we remove all flags.

The hidden details at this point are:
- flags will be restored automatically later on and we do not want to
hold the state here
- flags are not immutable between decodes
- this was a decision by the programmer to simplify the code and not a rule in the specification.

All of these things are not obvious from the code (from my POV) and
there are no pointers to the specification, which means the reader is
seemingly expected to know the specification on an expert level. I think
really understanding the H264 specification is hard enough on its own.
And as we do that change right now, I think we might as well take some
time to document as much hidden details as possible and I really think
that it will not lower the code quality when we add another 20-40 lines
of comments.

I might be wrong (as I still learn about H264) but I would love if we
can write code (especially open-source code) in a manner that enables
others to learn quickly.
