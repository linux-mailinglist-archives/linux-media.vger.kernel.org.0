Describing each PHY in its own device node (as we currently do)
results in:

        mipi_dphy_tx1rx1: mipi-dphy-tx1rx1@ff968000 {
                compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-mipi-dphy";
                reg = <0x0 0xff968000 0x0 0x8000>;
                rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
        };

        grf: syscon@ff770000 {
                mipi_dphy_rx0: mipi-dphy-rx0 {
                        compatible = "rockchip,rk3399-mipi-dphy";
                };
        };

Which is mildly ugly, as it uses two mechanism to describe
the GRF resource. In addition, the driver will then _infer_
which device node is RX0 and which is TX1RX1, from this.

Perhaps Laurent's proposal, describing each PHY explicitly,
would be cleaner?

Thanks,
Ezequiel
