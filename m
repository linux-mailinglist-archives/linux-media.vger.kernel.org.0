No, it does not impose any specific pattern to use for subsystems other tha=

requiring each device that's been *initialized* to provide a .release() cal=

And I've never said that it should not use reference counting. I'm not sure

I know how struct device works. I'm pointing out that this is a bad API (ju=
st
to be absolutely clear: not the reference counting of struct device itself =
but
using it in a way tha looks like it's not refcounted but becomes so after a=
n
API call) because it's confusing. I'm not buying the argument that if it
confuses you then you should not be doing kernel development because it's n=
ot
the goal of API design to make it as complex and confusing as possible - qu=
ite
the contrary. And it *is* confusing given the amount of misuse present. I'v=
e
heard Greg KH say on multiple occasions during his talks that we try to off=
load
complex code to subsystems so that drivers can remain fairly simple. I agre=
e
with that.

Yeah, that's awesome but that's not what's being done in i2c. We do:

struct foo_i2c_driver_data {
	struct i2c_adapter adap {
		struct device dev;
		...
	};
	...
};

instead which is a completely different story. It makes foo_i2c_driver_data
implicitly reference counted despite its lifetime being tied to the bound-s=
tate
of the device. It becomes painfully obvious in rust when the compiler start=
s
enforcing proper lifetime management.

What you showed above is totally fine. For an even simpler API, my personal
preference would be to:

xyz_probe()
{
	struct drv_data *data =3D kzalloc();
	/*
	 * ... stands for any other arguments or a config struct. In the concrete
	 * example of i2c, we'd supply the algo struct, fwnode, etc.
	 */
	struct i2c_adapter *adap =3D i2c_adapter_register(data, ...);
}

xyz_remove()
{
	kfree(data);
	i2c_adapter_unregister();
}

The reference counting of i2c_adapter happens behind the scenes in the
subsystem code. We're hiding the implementation details from the driver as =
it
has no business knowing it - it always only needs a single reference.

This way you have a kfree() corresponding with the kmalloc() and an
unregister() corresponding with the register().

But sure, your example works fine too. My point is: getting to that state w=
ould
require more churn than allowing drivers to continue allocating i2c_adapter
struct themselves with struct device being moved out of it - making referen=
ce
counting of it work properly.

And I agree: doing the above would be even better but you'd need - for ever=
y
driver - to move the i2c_adapter struct out of driver data and make it a
pointer. That's in addition to providing new APIs and using them. I2C drive=
rs
are spread treewide. There's a reason why nobody attempted it for decades. =
I'm
proposing something a bit less complex: allow drivers to free i2c_adapter a=
t
unbind but make i2c core keep a private, reference-counted structure for as
long as it's needed.

Sure, but my point all along has been that - with struct device currently
embedded in struct i2c_adapter - that's not the case. Driver data *and*
i2c_adapter are tied together. You need a major rework in either case.

I'm frustrated because I'm spending time working on an actual solution. I'v=
e
explained what I'm doing and what the end result will look like based on wh=
at
works for GPIO (struct gpio_chip's lifetime is bound to device's "bound" st=
ate,
struct gpio_device is refcounted, I want to mirror it with i2c_adapter and
whatever we eventually call its refcounted counterpart - let's say:
i2c_bus_device). If you claim you have a better alternative - will you do t=
he
work to make it happen?
