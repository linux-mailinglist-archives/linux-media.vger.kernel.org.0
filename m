Thank you for all this research.

Probably, but for those, the effort will pay off better, as we need to
control the flash from userspace. For the privacy LED, I doubt we'll
ever seen a system where we'll have to control it through more than an
enable bit (for instance, an RGB or intensity-controlled privacy LED
sounds very unlikely), so a GPIO is fine with me.
