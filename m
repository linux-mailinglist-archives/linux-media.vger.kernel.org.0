After a quick glance at Siano driver I am not sure about that being true
specifically for Siano devices just yet, but I understand your point
nonetheless.

Thank you for being so thorough with your answer. I think I
overestimated how much I should trust current driver implementation. I
should be (at least, in this case) looking at what hardware expects of
the driver.

Let me try to do a little more research into smsxxxx specs and maybe see
about getting my hands on some actual devices for testing.
