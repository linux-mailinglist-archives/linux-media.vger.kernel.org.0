No, that's really messy. Really, CREATE_BUFS should just use the buffer size
given. If the application wants to call TRY_FMT to obtain the size, then it is
free to do so and just use that in CREATE_BUFS. It is a bad idea to combine
TRY_FMT and creating new buffers into one ioctl. It should never have been
designed like that, and the fact that for all those years nobody bothered to
try to do anything with the format field besides getting the buffer size clearly
indicates that. It makes the ioctl much too complicated.

The only question here is whether to call the new ioctl 'DELETE_BUFS' or 'REMOVE_BUFS'.

If you have no particular preference, then I will just ask Benjamin to rename
it to REMOVE_BUFS and post a v20. It should be ready to go, hopefully.
