This all makes sense.

I take it as, for libcamera, users of the FrameBufferAllocator helper
(which first exports MMAP buffers from the video device and the
imports them back as DMABUF) won't be able to control the cache
policies.

Now, in the long term, we want FrameBufferAllocator to go away and
have either buffers exported by the consumer (likely DRM) or by a
system wide buffer allocator (when we'll have one) and have the video
devices operate as pure importers. But for the time being the
"first export then import" use case is possibile and valid so I wonder
if we should consider measures to allow controlling caching policies
for this use case too.
