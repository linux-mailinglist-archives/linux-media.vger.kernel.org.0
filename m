Hi Linus,

Thank you for your reply!

That's fair enough, but in that case I think the GPIO driver should set
can_sleep to true. Perhaps the pinctrl core can even check that can_sleep
is set to true if it attempts to call pinctrl_gpio_direction().

I believe that's the correct approach for such combined GPIO and pin
controllers. That whole loop through pinctrl_gpio_direction_output/input
just adds unnecessary complexity. Which is fine if you have no choice,
but wasteful otherwise.

It's likely also useful for i2c-gpio.c. I see that that one uses
gpiod_set_value_cansleep(), so using mutexes is fine, but avoiding that loop
through pinctrl will help improve timings there as well, even without
lock contention.

I'll post some patches, that should help discussing this.
