From the looks of things you have active-high VSYNC with active-low HREF.
HREF is not the same as HSYNC, in fact quite the opposite. V/H SYNC are
pulses, active only when there should be no data and the line/frame switch
happens, while V/H REF are held active when there is data. I personally
find these terms very confusing. :(

Now the timing diagrams in the Allwinner manuals would suggest that when
they are talking about H/V SYNC, they are actually referring to H/V REF.
The HSYNC line is high/active when there is valid data, and the VSYNC line
is high/active for the duration of the frame.

I think both sides need to be checked that they are using the correct
polarity, and maybe also have the media maintainers clarify how the
polarity should be interpreted when the hardware uses H/V ref instead
of H/V sync.
