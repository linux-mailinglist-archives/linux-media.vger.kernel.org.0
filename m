The current list of attendees is:

Sakari Ailus
Kieran Bingham
Nicolas Dufresne
Benjamin Gaignard
Paul Kocialkowski
Jacopo Mondi
Laurent Pinchart
Ricardo Ribalda
Maxime Ripard
Dave Stevenson (from 11 am)
Hans Verkuil
Philipp Zabel

Tentative:

Jernej Å krabec

So 12 confirmed attendees. The room holds 20 people, so if you are interested and
able to attend, then just let me know, there are still seats available.

I plan to post a first draft agenda next week.
