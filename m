No disagreement there. My question is whether there's a recommended
practice to avoid clashes, or if it's an unsolved problem that gets
ignored for now because there's only 36h in a day and there are more
urgent things to do.

I agree this can be improved. Paul, can you expand the description to
make it clearer in the next version ?

I'm in two minds about this. On one hand, using ports means we can reuse
standard properties, as well as helper code in the kernel, which is
nice. On the other hand, it means we would also need to add a DT node
to model the sensor, but the sensor isn't exposed to Linux, so we don't
want that node to cause a device being instantiated.

I think we'll need to add more properties related to the camera sensor
in the future. Coupled with the fact that the THP7312 actually has two
inputs to support two sensors at the same time (which neither the
bindings nor the driver curently support, but that's fine, they can be
added later), it would be nice to group all properties related to a
particular THP7312 input in a node. I've given this a try for the AP1302
(another external ISP) a while ago. The bindings have been posted in
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/20211006113254.3470-2-anil.mamidala@xilinx.com/.
It still doesn't connect the sensors to the ISP in DT, but it nicely
groups all sensor-related properties together. Is this something that
you would be happier with ?

Ignoring for a moment that the THP7312 has two inputs, there would be no
problem I think, as only one sensor is connected to the input. Different
sensor models can be used on different boards, but only one at a time.

To support the second input, we could add a thine,rx2,data-lanes
property. It's not great, but not that bad either if it stopped there.
However, if we later have to add additional sensor-related properties
(such as regulators for instance), it could become ugly. Grouping
sensor-related properties in child sensor nodes would be nicer I
believe.
