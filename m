Hi Krzysztof, Nicholas,

Thanks for the quick review.

There is a possible scenario with multiple applications accessing the device
node simultaneously (and so multiple m2m_ctx are possible as seen in below
logs) and these prints were helpful to debug/analyze these scenarios.

Infact, actually I had added these prints while debugging an issue with this
type of multistream scenario, where I was launching like 20 instances of JPEG
encoding and some of the instances were hanging, these prints were helpful to
fix that scenario and I later still kept these prints as they may help in
future in case any issue is encountered while adding a new feature or in
further testing.

I have also already put the logs for this multi-stream scenario in gist shared
in commit message, below is the exact line :
