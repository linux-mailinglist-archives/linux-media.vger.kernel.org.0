Ok thank you, this is clear and I understand your position. Yes
Android does things a little differently. My team is actually hoping
to create a presentation on this topic explaining why things are the
way they are because these differences keep coming up in discussions.

The inode number rollover happened after running for two weeks, but
that's still around 300M a day which is extraordinary, so I think they
must have been stress testing. But yes the Android graphics stack does
make much more use of DMA-bufs than other users.

Cgroups definitely would help out with per-application accounting.
Much nicer than parsing through procfs. For our use case this requires
associating the exporter name with the cgroup resource, which is part
of the data that comes from sysfs now. I have some patches which do
this, but this naming component is a point of contention at the
moment. Maybe it would be better to focus efforts on the problem of
how to categorize and aggregate (or not aggregate) graphics resources
for accounting with cgroups in a way that suits everyone's needs.

Thanks,
