When we added support for omap3, back in 2010, we added a new
type of V4L2 devices that aren't fully controlled via the V4L2
device node.

Yet, we have never clearly documented in the V4L2 specification
the differences between the two types.

Let's document them based on the the current implementation.

+
+Controlling a hardware peripheral via V4L2
+==========================================
+
+V4L2 hardware peripheral is usually complex: support for it is
+implemented via a bridge driver and often by several additional drivers.
+The bridge driver exposes one or more V4L2 device nodes
+(see :ref:`v4l2_device_naming`).
+
+There are other drivers providing support for other components of
+the hardware, with may also expose device nodes, called V4L2 sub-devices.
+
+When such V4L2 sub-devices are exposed, they allow controlling
+other hardware components - usually connected via a serial bus (like
+IÂ²C, SMBus or SPI). Depending on the bridge driver, those sub-devices
+can be controlled indirectly via the bridge driver or explicitly via
+the :ref:`Media Controller <media_controller>` and via the
+:ref:`V4L2 sub-devices <subdev>`.
+
+The devices that require the use of the
+:ref:`Media Controller <media_controller>` are called **MC-centric**
+devices. The devices that are fully controlled via V4L2 device nodes
+are called **video-node-centric**.
+
+Userspace can check if a V4L2 hardware peripheral is MC-centric by
+calling :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` and checking the
+:ref:`device_caps field <device-capabilities>`.
+
+If the device returns ``V4L2_CAP_IO_MC`` flag at ``device_caps``,
+it is MC-centric, otherwise, it is video-node-centric.
+
+It is required for MC-centric hardware to identify the V4L2
+sub-devices and to configure the pipelines via the
+:ref:`media controller API <media_controller>` before using the peripheral.
+Also, the sub-devices' configuration shall be controlled via the
+:ref:`sub-device API <subdev>`.
+
+.. note::
+
+   A video-node-centric may still provide a both media-controller and
+   sub-device interfaces as well.
