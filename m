That's an important distinction. If there are operations that can run
while the main host is in 'suspend' and still maintain "relative"
timestamps in any form - then time must continue during suspend.

Agreed, this is a V4L2 topic - not a UVC specific topic.

What kind of 'compatibility' do we actually need to maintain here? IMO -
CLOCK_BOOTTIME makes much more sense globally for video, because it's
more representative of the temporal difference between frames captured
if a system goes into suspend.

If frames are captured:

A B         C D
   <suspend>

Then I believe it would be correct for the timestamp delta between B-C
to be large <representative of the suspend duration/real time>


> Any thoughts?

Aha, there might be some gotchas around non-live sources operating
across suspend-resume boundaries .. so perhaps there are certainly
use-cases where both _MONOTONIC and _BOOTTIME have their relevance ...


> Adding Hans and Kieran for more insight.

I think if we're talking about core-V4L2, Hans' opinion takes more
weight than my mumblings :-) - but overall - supporting _BOOTTIME in
some form sounds beneficial to me.
