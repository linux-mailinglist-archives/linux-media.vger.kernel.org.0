I'm a bit unhappy about the order of these patches.

It mixes core and driver patches, making it hard to follow. Also, the
driver patches are missing CCs to the driver maintainers.

There are two types of driver patches:

1) switch to vb2_get_buffer()
2) switch to vb2_get_num_buffers(), or stop using num_buffers altogether.

I am not counting the patches for verisilicon and the test drivers that
add support for max_num_buffers, those are separate.

In order to support more than 32 buffers the first phase is to fix the
drivers.

I would suggest the following:

1) start with a videobuf2-core.h patch adding vb2_get_num_buffers()
   (so just the header part of patch 21/54).
2) then add all driver patches switching to vb2_get_buffer/vb2_get_num_buffers(),
   grouped by driver (so e.g. the two amphion patches are placed together).

Also add CCs to the driver maintainers for each driver patch, allowing them
to review the code.

Also include patches 10/54 and 22/54 (dvb-core).

The remaining patches for vb2 etc. and for drivers patches adding support for
the new features should be posted as a separate series on top of this.

I want to get the driver changes in first. That will greatly simplify the
remaining work.

What will also be very helpful if this approach is taken is that it should
be no problem to merge the initial patch adding the new vb2_get_num_buffers
function for v6.7. That makes it easier to convert drivers in phases, if
needed. And new upcoming drivers can start to use this function as well.

Regards,

	Hans
