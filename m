Hi Krzysztof,

Thank you for the patch.

Please move the text below after a --- line, it shouldn't be included in
the commit message.

This shouldn't be too much of a problem, as long as you MUA and MTA
don't mess up encoding.

This may be more problematic, especially in strings in source code.

You can drop the description, it's implied by the clock-names property.

Isn't the pin named extclk ?

It's not just the digital core, 1.2V is also needed for the PLL
(VDD_PLL) and the PHY (VDD_PHY). I'd call this vdd-supply.

Similarly, I'd call this vaa-supply is is covers VAA and VAA_PIX
(there's no VCC_ANALOG pin).

The number of lanes should be described through the data-lanes endpoint
property.

Supplies should be mandatory as the chip needs them.
