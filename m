The DM3730 TRM (SPRUGN4R =E2=80=93 May 2010 =E2=80=93 Revised September 201=
2) doesn't
use the 90% rule mentioned above from what I can see. Maybe it's
somewhere else, but I didn't see it.  It does state the folllowing in
Section 6.3.1.1:
Camera ISP Clocks Parallel interface clock domain. This frequency
depends on the imaging sensor type and size, its frame rate and its
blanking time. The functional clock is required to be at least 2x
faster than the pixel clock when the bridge is disabled and a least
equal when it is enabled.

When I queried the cam_ick, it returned 100MHz, so I expected 96MHz to
be tolerated.

# cat cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/l3_ick/clk_rate
200000000

# cat /sys/kernel/debug/clk/cam_ick/clk_rate
100000000

For what it's worth, I removed the 90% calculation and just use the L3
/ 2.  With that done, I was able to push the camera to 96MHz, and the
frame rate increased

Can you point me to where this 90% requirement is located?
