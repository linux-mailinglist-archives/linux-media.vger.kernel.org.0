Hi Nikita,

Thank you for the patch.

We could also use the reset provided by the SRCR registers in the CPG.
In the meantime, this patch seems to go in the right direction, it fixes
the problem without being too intrusive.

This should be unsigned int as it never takes negative values.

I would add

	 * TODO: Investigate if this shouldn't be better handled by using the
	 * device reset provided by the CPG.

to avoid forgetting about it.

If you're fine with those two changes, there's no need for a v3, I can
handle this when applying the patch.
