Well, they were (or are) related to firmware issues that cause systems
to fail to boot if triggered until they get blacklisted in
acpi_graph_ignore_port().

It doesn't matter too much whether this is specifically DisCo for
Imaging or something else.

So why don't we put MTL into the list in the Hans' patch?  Or are we
going to wait for someone to report a boot failure on MTL because of
this?
