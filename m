Given that the NXP revealed that the MIPI DSI controller in the i.MX8 is from
Northwest Logic and the block diagram for the MIPI CSI controller in NXP's
reference manual looks like it was drawn by the same artist who drew the block
diagram in Northwest Logic's DSI product brief, I suspect that the CSI
controller is also an IP core from Northwest Logic. I believe the one currently
advertized on their website is the successor. I don't have access to Northwest
Logic's datasheet, so I can't compare the register layouts.

Looking at the driver from NXP we can probably rule out that the driver will be
used with anything else than NXP hardware. Half of the register accesses in that
driver go to additional logic specific to the i.MX8 (CSR registers) and there is
communication with the chip-internal Cortex-M4 to reset the CSI controller. NXP
placed it into drivers/media/platform/imx8/.

Best regards,

  Daniel
