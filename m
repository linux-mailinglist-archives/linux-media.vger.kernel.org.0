Hi Dave,

Thank you for the suggestion about the stereoscopic capture! If you'll
manage to test this patch and it will work for you, then please feel
free to give yours tested-by.

I'll need to do couple extra checks to ensure that we really need this
new feature for the Chromebooks, this will take time. But if you'll be
able to confirm that this variant of the patch works for yours case with
the stereo cams, then we may try to proceed using the current variant
right away.
