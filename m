Remember the guy reported the hw fix? Could be that
only some receiver units are affected. ThereforeÂ  the
module param.

The hw fix was original 4k7 and 10k added. That looks
like 3k3 total and all 3 chips on the bus work. 10k per
chip. Now Gon reported that said bus works with 2 chips
active on a faulty device with 4k7 resistor, which is 2
times 10k. It looks same hw error to me.

If it is a failing pull-up resistor on only some individual receiver
units, this seems overkill to me. In my proposal I did not realized
this change in the demod driver was needed.

Thank you.
