This is something I'd really like to see, but it's way more work.

There's an important need of applying changes atomically, which is often
not possible to strictly guarantee over I2C. Userspace ends up writing
V4L2 controls as quickly as it can after the start of a frame, hoping
they will all reach the sensor before the end of the frame. Some
platforms have camera-specific I2C controllers that have the ability to
buffer I2C transfers and issue them based on a hardware trigger. How to
fit this in th√© kernel I2C API will be an interesting exercise.
