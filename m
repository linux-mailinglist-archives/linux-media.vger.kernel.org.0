There is a difference at which point they can get combined. With 
write-combine they can be coalesced into a single transaction anywhere 
in the interconnect, as early as the CPU itself. Without write-cobmine 
the DDR controller might decide to combine them, but not earlier. This 
can make a difference especially if the write is a narrow write, i.e. 
the access size is smaller than the buswidth.

Lets say you do 32-bit writes, but your bus is 64 bits wide. With WC two 
32-bits can be combined into a 64-bit write. Without WC that is not 
possible and you are potentially not using the bus to its fullest 
capacity. This is especially true if the memory bus is wider than the 
widest access size of the CPU.
