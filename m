Yeah I think that's hopeless. I think the only feasible approach is if bus
drivers claim resources by default when a driver is bound (it should nest,
so if the driver claims again, I think that should all keep working), just
using the driver name. Probably with some special casing for legacy io
(vgaarb.c should claim these I guess). Still probably tons of fallout.

Once that's rolled out to all bus drivers we could perhaps add the ioremap
check without drowning in log spam. Still a multi-year project I think :-/
