Nope, as it matches (I'd say). The reporter never bisected this and just
claimed that 6.3.5 was fine and 6.3.7 was broken (and 6.3.6 iirc was
never tested). In that case we tell regzbot that the culprit is
somewhere in that range (which is was[1]), as that's the important thing
to know in the context of the 6.3.y regression (that it also happened in
mainline is a different story).

Is this too confusing? Would it be better to handle things differently
somehow?

Ciao, Thorsten
