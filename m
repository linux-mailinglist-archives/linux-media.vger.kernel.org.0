So if I understand this correctly (from a quick look), this would be to all=
ow
stateless encoder drivers to attach a particular control value to a specific
returned frame?

I guess this would be a good match to return statistics about the encoded f=
rame.
However that would probably be expressed in a hardware-specific way so it
seems preferable to not expose this to userspace and handle it in-kernel
instead.

What's really important for userspace to know (in order to do user-side
rate-control, which we definitely want to support) is the resulting bitstre=
am
size. This is already available with bytesused.

So all in all I think we're good with the current status of request support.

Cheers,

Paul
