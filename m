I haven't found any mention about the BIT(6) polarity. IOW I haven't
found documented if setting it to 1 enters or exists SW standby mode.

Your reasoning is valid, I'm just a bit surprised the SCCB is active
and registers can be programmed while in standby mode.

However, this

#define OV5640_REG_SYS_CTRL0_SW_PWDN	0x42
#define OV5640_REG_SYS_CTRL0_SW_PWUP	0x02

seems to confirm what you said.

That's what confused me. init_settings[] are programmed for both DVP
and MIPI. If the last write to 0x3008 is 0x02 there shouldn't be any
need to re-program it. However since ov5640_set_stream_dvp() is called
in the s_stream() call path it means SW standby is entered between
every streaming session.

Please note that no 5msec delay is respected when
existing/entering sw standby between streaming session.

I was suggesting to use sw reset/powerup if no gpios are registered.

Do you interpret "Manually applying a reset upon power up" to imply
"software reset" ? As I read it it doesn't require the reset to be
SW or HW.

That's what I was suggesting. If you have gpios you shouldn't need
initial SW resets and powerup. If you don't have gpios, use sw reset
so that the reset/powerup routines are centralized and not spread between
register tables and functions ?

What setup are you testing with ? DVP or MIPI ? With gpios or without
? I can test on a 2-data lanes MIPI setup with HW gpio lines if it
helps.

Thanks
