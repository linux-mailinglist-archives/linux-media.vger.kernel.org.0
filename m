Interesting, I never noticed this one. I suppose this would mean some early
notification of decode error. I have always assumed that for m2m, the flags
after DQBUF had no meaning, considering we are just getting back an empty
buffer. I do see possible enhancement of error handling if that was to be
implemented.

For more context, if a reordered frame failed, we will only know after we had
notice failures / errors on dependent frame that are earlier in display order.
Such mechanism would tell us earlier. I wonder if it could not also be earlier
still when no reordering take place ? In general, the main goal with such
mechanism is to request a new keyframe (typically in WebRTC / RTP use cases).

To answer you question, the spec says "if the decoder is able", which looks like
a MAY in specification terminology. So if you don't also produce a capture
buffer for the error, I would be worried existing userland will not notice and
keep waiting for the lost frame. Adding Alexandre Courbot in CC, he may have
more context around this, and perhaps Chromium is using that.
