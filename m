The current names are indeed confusing, doubly so as it is
exposed to applications.

Getting rid of these, shows that the subsystem is not haunted
by historical choices, that don't make sense anymore, soÂ seems
a good idea, and worth the trouble IMO.

And indeed distinguishing CODEC-specific from MPEG-specific controls
will be less painful.

Would be great to script the change.
