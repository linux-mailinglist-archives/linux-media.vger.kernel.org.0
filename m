This file contains both driver develompent documentation and
userspace API.

Split on two, as they're usually read by different audiences.

+- V4L2_EVENT_IMX_FRAME_INTERVAL_ERROR

+.. _imx_api_FIM:
+
+Frame Interval Monitor in ipuX_csiY
+-----------------------------------
+
+The adv718x decoders can occasionally send corrupt fields during
+NTSC/PAL signal re-sync (too little or too many video lines). When
+this happens, the IPU triggers a mechanism to re-establish vertical
+sync by adding 1 dummy line every frame, which causes a rolling effect
+from image to image, and can last a long time before a stable image is
+recovered. Or sometimes the mechanism doesn't work at all, causing a
+permanent split image (one frame contains lines from two consecutive
+captured images).
+
+From experiment it was found that during image rolling, the frame
+intervals (elapsed time between two EOF's) drop below the nominal
+value for the current standard, by about one frame time (60 usec),
+and remain at that value until rolling stops.
+
+While the reason for this observation isn't known (the IPU dummy
+line mechanism should show an increase in the intervals by 1 line
+time every frame, not a fixed value), we can use it to detect the
+corrupt fields using a frame interval monitor. If the FIM detects a
+bad frame interval, the ipuX_csiY subdev will send the event
+V4L2_EVENT_IMX_FRAME_INTERVAL_ERROR. Userland can register with
+the FIM event notification on the ipuX_csiY subdev device node.
+Userland can issue a streaming restart when this event is received
+to correct the rolling/split image.
+
+The ipuX_csiY subdev includes custom controls to tweak some dials for
+FIM. If one of these controls is changed during streaming, the FIM will
+be reset and will continue at the new settings.

+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_ENABLE

+Enable/disable the FIM.
+
+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_NUM
+
+How many frame interval measurements to average before comparing against
+the nominal frame interval reported by the sensor. This can reduce noise
+caused by interrupt latency.
+
+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_TOLERANCE_MIN
+
+If the averaged intervals fall outside nominal by this amount, in
+microseconds, the V4L2_EVENT_IMX_FRAME_INTERVAL_ERROR event is sent.
+
+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_TOLERANCE_MAX
+
+If any intervals are higher than this value, those samples are
+discarded and do not enter into the average. This can be used to
+discard really high interval errors that might be due to interrupt
+latency from high system load.
+
+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_NUM_SKIP
+
+How many frames to skip after a FIM reset or stream restart before
+FIM begins to average intervals.
+
+- V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_ICAP_CHANNEL / V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_ICAP_EDGE
+
+These controls will configure an input capture channel as the method
+for measuring frame intervals. This is superior to the default method
+of measuring frame intervals via EOF interrupt, since it is not subject
+to uncertainty errors introduced by interrupt latency.
+
+Input capture requires hardware support. A VSYNC signal must be routed
+to one of the i.MX6 input capture channel pads.
+
+V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_ICAP_CHANNEL configures which i.MX6 input capture
+channel to use. This must be 0 or 1.
+
+V4L2_CID_IMX_FIM_ICAP_EDGE configures which signal edge will trigger
+input capture events. By default the input capture method is disabled
+with a value of IRQ_TYPE_NONE. Set this control to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING,
+IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING, or IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_BOTH to enable input capture,
+triggered on the given signal edge(s).
+
+When input capture is disabled, frame intervals will be measured via
+EOF interrupt.
