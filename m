No, it's a requirement in the h/w, driver trigger core start encoding
is in order.
About the encoder hardware block diagram, please check below:

                             \/

       |                  core0/core1                  |
       |          enable/disable power/clk/irq         |
       +-----------------------------------------------+
--------------------------------------------------------------
As above , there are parent and child devices, child mean each venc
core, the child device controls the information of each core
independent which inlcude power/clk/irq.
When start encoding, input buffer 0 will be encoded by core0, and input
buffer 1 can be encoded by core1 even if buffer 0 has not been encoded
done yet, after buffer 0 encoded done, buffer 2 will be encoded by
core0, and buffer 1 encoded done by core1. These two encoder cores will
encode each input in this overlapping manner.

We need manage each child device in parent device by core-id property.
And we also need record current encoding input buffer, encode done
output buffers and which one core is in used through core-id, because
the two cores are encoding at the same time under one parent driver.
