I wonder if it makes sense to have a more standardized hantro schema
for all the users instead of one dedicated to each platform using a
hantro driver.  The unified schema could have all the various
compatible flags so the driver still knows which features are
enabled/disabled and it's very clear who all the users are for it. I
would think it could cover both the encoder and decoder variants as
well.  We do something similar for 8250 serial ports.

If so, can someone from the media group suggest the best one to
follow?  Ezequiel suggested I look at the sama5d4-vdec to help reduce
some clutter in the driver.  If that binding is good enough, should I
just add the compatible flags to that and potentially rename it.
