The meaning of "new" depends on people.

The 'modules_prepare' target was added in 2004.

This commit:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/commit/=
?id=3D95065ad3fa787c417008a36d3a5d9a3bab17ab98


I do not think it is new, but you may think differently.






One more thing,
please tell me the motivation to do:

 make M=3Ddrivers/staging/media/atomisp



The main usage of M=3D is to build external modules.
If you want to compile the individual directory,
you can do this:

 make drivers/staging/media/stomisp/
