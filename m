This flag is specific to the control ID: so if set, then you can get
the min/max value using V4L2_CTRL_WHICH_MIN/MAX_VAL for that control ID.

This flag must be set for any control that uses the s64 minimum/maximum
fields in struct v4l2_ext_query_ctrl, and for any compound control that
has explicit support for MIN/MAX_VAL (the UVC rectangle control in this
case).
