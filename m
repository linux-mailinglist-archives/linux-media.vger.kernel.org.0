Add bindings documentation for Microchip CSI2 Demultiplexer controller.

CSI2DC is a demultiplexer from Synopsys IDI interface specification to
parallel interface connection or direct memory access.
CSI2DC can also act as a parallel bypass from a parallel sensor to the
image sensor controller/interface.

Changes in v3:
- Changed to port base as suggested by Rob
- Added properties from video-interfaces which are being used by the csi2dc
- added mention to the parallel port type as input
- did some rephrasing and rewording

Changes in v2:
- changed the endpoint/port references as suggested by Rob

Changes in this version :
- fixed 'sink' name to be actually source.
- added dma properties and example with dma

Previous change log:
Changes in v5:
- modified bindings as per Rob Herring review

Changes in v4:
- Removed property for inter-line-delay and for clock continuous/non-continuous
- Removed virtual channel by reg for second endpoint

Changes in v3:
- Removed some text from description, as it was explained in the schema
- fixed other things as per Rob's review
- moved some text inside the schema, like the clock description

Changes in v2:
- fixed warnings reported by dt_binding_check

+title: Microchip CSI2 Demux Controller (CSI2DC)
+

+
+description:
+  CSI2DC - Camera Serial Interface 2 Demux Controller
+
+  CSI2DC is a hardware block that receives incoming data from either from an
+  IDI interface or from a parallel bus interface.
+  It filters IDI packets based on their data type and virtual channel
+  identifier, then converts the byte stream to a pixel stream into a cross
+  clock domain towards a parallel interface that can be read by a sensor
+  controller.
+  IDI interface is Synopsys proprietary.
+  CSI2DC can act a simple bypass bridge if the incoming data is coming from
+  a parallel interface.
+
+  CSI2DC provides two pipes, one video pipe and one data pipe. Video pipe
+  is connected at the output to a sensor controller and the data pipe is
+  accessible as a DMA slave port to a DMA controller.
+
+  CSI2DC supports a single 'port' node as a sink port with either Synopsys
+  32-bit IDI interface or a parallel interface.
+
+  CSI2DC supports one 'port' node as source port with parallel interface.
+  This is called video pipe.
+  This port has an 'endpoint' that can be connected to a sink port of another
+  controller (next in pipeline).
+
+  CSI2DC also supports direct access to the data through AHB, via DMA channel,
+  called data pipe.
+  For data pipe to be available, a dma controller and a dma channel must be
+  referenced.

+      CSI2DC must have two clocks to function correctly. One clock is the
+      peripheral clock for the inside functionality of the hardware block.
+      This is named 'pclk'. The second clock must be the cross domain clock,
+      in which CSI2DC will perform clock crossing. This clock must be fed
+      by the next controller in pipeline, which usually is a sensor controller.
+      Normally this clock should be given by this sensor controller who
+      is also a clock source. This clock is named 'scck', sensor controller clock.
