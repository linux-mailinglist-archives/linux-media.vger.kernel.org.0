Sure
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmondi/linux.git/
jmondi/renesas-drivers-2024-04-23-v6.9-rc5/multistream

I should have added it to the cover letter

Ouch, right. I can do that but won't be able to test. Would you ?

I'm afraid the latter. I really hope in the next kernel release we can
get rid of this protection and enable streams by default.

I had the same idea, but I'm not yet sure how this would work when a
CSI-2 can be routed to multiple VIN groups...

Exactly, I didn't want to pile too many things. max9286 routing would
be next in line, I kept it out to avoid sending 30 patches in one go
(and to send this out earlier to get feedbacks)
