So it is OK not to provide ANY information about supported formats and just
leave it to userspace to guess? I'm happy to just say that ENUM_FMT enumerates
all supported formats (and allowing them to be rejected if they do not work
with the actual pipeline), that's already FAR better than not enumerating
anything at all.

It's insane that this is apparently still not sorted so long after this driver
was merged.

Well, make an RFC. Seriously. How can you even write libcamera without this
being sorted?

Fix this!

I strongly recommend that you look at Boris' RFC v3 (https://patchwork.linuxtv.org/cover/59345/)
that will be the main discussion during the 'Future work' session in Lyon,
and post an RFC this week with a suggestion on how to integrate this into
a new API.

It is unlikely that this can be integrated into the existing VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
since while there are reserved fields, there is no requirement for userspace
to zero them. They can only be used to return information from the driver.
(Sorry Sakari, your proposal to use a reserved field for the mediabus format
won't work).

So the best ENUM_FMT can do for these drivers is to enumerate all supported
pixelformats, but without any information on the mediabus formats they can
be used with.

And after we agree on the API, then this needs to be implemented first in vimc
and compliance tests added to v4l2-compliance. If no corner cases pop up when
doing that, then the proposed API is likely OK and it can be incorporated into
the spec. We *have* to stop adding APIs without support in the virtual drivers
and compliance tests, since doing that later *always* finds corner cases that
we forgot in the initial design.
