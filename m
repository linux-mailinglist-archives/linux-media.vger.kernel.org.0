Ideally uvc should just use centralized locking (i.e. set vdev->queue.lock)
for the video node, just like it does for the meta device.

If that was the case, then it can just call vb2_video_unregister_device().
The vb2_video_unregister_device helper was added to ensure that no ioctls
are running, and then streaming is stopped and the queue is released.

While it is true that the queue is released automatically when the last user
closes the filehandle, it can get complicated if the application has a file
handle open when the device is unregistered (usually due to it being unplugged).
Without that call to vb2_video_unregister_device() the queue is still active,
and especially if you also have subdevices that are still in streaming mode,
it is hard to make sure nothing is still using the hardware.

vb2_video_unregister_device() provides a clean way of ensuring that when the
device is unregistered all streaming is stopped and the vb2 queue is released.

After that the only file operation that can be used without returning an error
is close().

Since uvc uses its own locking for the video device, it has to do this manually.
It is probably enough to ensure no ioctls are running since uvc doesn't have
subdevices, but I think it makes sense to stop streaming and release the queue
when unregistering the device, it is weird to postpone that until the last fh
is closed.
