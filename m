I see the HDMI and analog front-end adjusting the value of PIXEL_RATE
control through adv748x_csi2_set_pixelrate() which however only update
the value of the control. The ADV748x automatically adjusts the "MIPI
output frequency" (Chapter 9.6 of the chip manual) according to the
pixel rate, so I concur it is not possible/resonable to express all
the possible values as menu control items.

To be honest I always had troubles with LINK_FREQ being a menu
control, as it requires to pre-calculate all of the possible values it
can assume when the bus link frequency varies according to the pixel
rate or to the image format and output size.

I agree with most of this. I'm also concerned changing a control type
which userspace has access to might be considered a regression, so I
guess we have to live with LINK_FREQ as a menu control.

I wonder if we shouldn't instead move away from controls and report
the CSI-2 link frequency between the transmitter and the receiver
drivers through the .get_mbus_config pad operation..
