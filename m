So while I kind of agree with you on the technical side (as you can
see from my messages in this thread), there is one thing in the above
paragraph that I need to react to.

Namely, both I and Sakari are Intel employees.  Do you think or are
you suggesting that we are somehow responsible for this failure?
Because I personally don't think like I have anything to do with it.

What do you mean, specifically, by saying "if Intel doesn't address
the issue on their side"?  And who at Intel do I need to talk to about
this?
