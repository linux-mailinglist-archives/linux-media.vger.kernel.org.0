I am dropping this series from patchwork: clearly this generated
a lot of discussion, and I think that needs to come to a conclusion.

BTW, I believe that at minimum the codec-specific parts in
v4l2-mem2mem.c should be split off in their own source (v4l2-m2m-codec.c?).

I agree with Tomasz that mem2mem.c was originally for simple m2m devices,
and adding all sorts of codec specific code to that source doesn't make
it easier to follow.
