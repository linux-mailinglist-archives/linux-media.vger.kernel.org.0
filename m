Hi,

This series adds support for CSI2 capture on J721E. It includes some
fixes to the Cadence CSI2RX driver, re-structures the TI platform
drivers, and finally adds the TI CSI2RX wrapper driver.

This series used to include the DPHY and DMA engine patches as well, but
they have been split off to facilitate easier merging.

Tested on TI's J721E with OV5640 sensor.

The branch with all the patches needed to enable testing (dts nodes,
OV5640 dropped patch, etc.) can be found here at
https://github.com/prati0100/linux-next/ branch "capture".

Changes in v4:
- Drop the call to set PHY submode. It is now being done via compatible
  on the DPHY side.
- Acquire the media device's graph_mutex before starting the graph walk.
- Call media_graph_walk_init() and media_graph_walk_cleanup() when
  starting and ending the graph walk respectively.
- Reduce max frame height and width in enum_framesizes. Currently they
  are set to UINT_MAX but they must be a multiple of step_width, so they
  need to be rounded down. Also, these values are absurdly large which
  causes some userspace applications like gstreamer to trip up. While it
  is not generally right to change the kernel for an application bug, it
  is not such a big deal here. This change is replacing one set of
  absurdly large arbitrary values with another set of smaller but still
  absurdly large arbitrary values. Both limits are unlikely to be hit in
  practice.
- Add power-domains property.
- Drop maxItems from clock-names.
- Drop the type for data-lanes.
- Drop uniqueItems from data-lanes. Move it to video-interfaces.yaml
  instead.
- Drop OV5640 runtime pm patch. It seems to be a bit complicated and it
  is not exactly necessary for this series. Any CSI-2 camera will work
  just fine, OV5640 just happens to be the one I tested with. I don't
  want it to block this series. I will submit it as a separate patch
  later.

Changes in v3:
- Use v4l2_get_link_freq() to calculate pixel clock.
- Move DMA related fields in struct ti_csi2rx_dma.
- Protect DMA buffer queue with a spinlock to make sure the queue buffer
  and DMA callback don't race on it.
- Track the current DMA state. It might go idle because of a lack of
  buffers. This state can be used to restart it if needed.
- Do not include the current buffer in the pending queue. It is slightly
  better modelling than leaving it at the head of the pending queue.
- Use the buffer as the callback argument, and add a reference to csi in it.
- If queueing a buffer to DMA fails, the buffer gets leaked and DMA gets
  stalled with. Instead, report the error to vb2 and queue the next
  buffer in the pending queue.
- DMA gets stalled if we run out of buffers since the callback is the
  only one that fires subsequent transfers and it is no longer being
  called. Check for that when queueing buffers and restart DMA if
  needed.
- Do not put of node until we are done using the fwnode.
- Set inital format to UYVY 640x480.
- Add compatible: contains: const: cdns,csi2rx to allow SoC specific
  compatible.
- Add more constraints for data-lanes property.

Changes in v2:
- Use phy_pm_runtime_get_sync() and phy_pm_runtime_put() before making
  calls to set PHY mode, etc. to make sure it is ready.
- Use dmaengine_get_dma_device() instead of directly accessing
  dma->device->dev.
- Do not set dst_addr_width when configuring slave DMA.
- Move to a separate subdir and rename to j721e-csi2rx.c
- Convert compatible to ti,j721e-csi2rx.
- Move to use Media Controller centric APIs.
- Improve cleanup in probe when one of the steps fails.
- Add colorspace to formats database.
- Set hw_revision on media_device.
- Move video device initialization to probe time instead of register time.
- Rename to ti,j721e-csi2rx.yaml
- Add an entry in MAINTAINERS.
- Add a description for the binding.
- Change compatible to ti,j721e-csi2rx to make it SoC specific.
- Remove description from dmas, reg, power-domains.
- Remove a limit of 2 from #address-cells and #size-cells.
- Fix add ^ to csi-bridge subnode regex.
- Make ranges mandatory.
- Add unit address in example.
- Add a reference to cdns,csi2rx in csi-bridge subnode.
- Expand the example to include the csi-bridge subnode as well.
- Re-order subject prefixes.
- Convert OV5640 to use runtime PM and drop Cadence CSI2RX s_power patch.
- Drop subdev call wrappers from cdns-csi2rx.
- Move VPE and CAL to a separate subdir.
- Rename ti-csi2rx.c to j721e-csi2rx.c
