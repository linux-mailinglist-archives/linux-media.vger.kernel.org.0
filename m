That sounds like something that can fit V4L2 MEM2MEM driver.
You queue two buffers and an operation, and then run a job.

I'm not entirely sure we are missing a framework. What's missing in
V4L2 MEM2MEM?

Before considering drivers/staging, it would be interesting to figure
out if V4L2 can do it as-is, and if not, discuss what's missing.
