The thing is, it's really not clear why you absolutely need to have the
Panthor driver involved there. It won't be transparent to userspace,
since you'd need an extra flag at allocation time, and the buffers
behave differently. If userspace has to be aware of it, what's the
advantage to your approach compared to just exposing a heap for those
secure buffers, and letting userspace allocate its buffers from there?

Sure, but we still have to address *why* it would be a good idea for the
driver to do it in the first place. The mediatek series had the same
feedback.
