So you captured it with a logic analyzer?

Right, so changing the dev_dbg() to dev_info() did work, although that is
not the correct fix.

It would be interesting to know if the problem is in the gpio device, or
if there is a problem with further processing in the IR layers.

What is the device you are using?

I think it would be interesting to add a debug printk in gpio_ir_recv_irq
with the ktime and the val. We can see then if correct data is being
generated here, or if things go wrong in the IR layers.

I wouldn't be surprised if the gpio device generates two interrupts for the
broken pulse (one after 690us and another at 1200us), and if decoding happens
before the second then the wrong pulse length is used.

> I also have a question, if RC transmit repeatedly 6 times, and SONY decodes decode all raw data successfully, it will report to input subsystem 6 times, does input subsystem will still report to userspace 6 times?

If the sony decodes the same values 6 times, then scancode will reported 6
imes, but there will be only one key down event, and a key up event about
100ms after the the last decode (plus a few other milliseconds for various
timeouts).

Thanks,

Sean
