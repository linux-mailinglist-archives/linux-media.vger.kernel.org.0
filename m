I usually rely on what git log suggests me if in doubt.

True that. And an #ifdef is maybe undesirable.

Although, if with idle you can power-down the chip after probe, I'm
fine with that

The warning suggests to go for

        /*
         * This when a comment
         * spans on multiple lines
         */

instead of

        /* Going for this style when
           a comment is on multiple lines */
