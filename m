I mis-interpreted this, where it got all wrong. I assumed single VT 
pixel clock = no. of pixels processed in one second which is not correct.

I have been pointed out that pixel clock and pixel clock rate (frequency 
I suppose) are different. I thought in terms of "Hz" :-S

So yes if 1 VT pixel clock is duration ofÂ  one pixel processing from 
pixel_array, the line_length_pck is correct without this patch.
