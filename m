According to the NXP i.MX8MQ docs, "The G2 decoder conforms to the
HEVC Main/Main 10 profiles and can decode streams up to level 5.1."

If I'm reading the levels correctly, level 5.1 =3D 4,096=C3=972,160@60.0.  =
If
the decoder can achieve this throughput at 300MHz, then there should
be no reason to go higher?  My speculation though is that when run at
300MHz, the decoder is not able to decode this fast.

Adam, can you determine the throughput at the different frequencies to
see if 300MHz can support 4K60 decode?
