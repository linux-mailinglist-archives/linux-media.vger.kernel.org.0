It would be messy if some drivers under a

	media/platform/vendor_a/

directory would actually belong to vendor_b, which also has its own
media/platform/vendor_b/ directory.

On such case, I do think we should move stuff. Now, if everything
under a "media/platform/vendor_a/" directory are now property of
a vendor_c which doesn't have yet any directory there, I don't see
and problems on not renaming - and even adding new drivers there
that would belong to vendor_c.

Nah, we had other reorgs in the past, also trying to better organize
stuff, like splitting M2M from V4L and DVB platform drivers.

The thing is that the number of entries at platform/ increased
a lot, and that justifies a major change.

Agreed.

Works for me.
