Oh. I missed this. Thanks for pointing it out.

If the first data lane must be 1, then your check is still different: it
requires all the data lanes are greater than 1. Are there requireents for
the clock lane position? Looking at the driver, it seems it does not care
about the clock lane, and an educated guess gives 0 for the clock lane.

The DT binding documentation actually omits documenting the data-lanes
altogether. Please add it in a separate patch. I don't think "clock-lanes"
is needed _if_ zero is all you need, so please remove it also from the
examples.

It's actually nice to have more users for this feature. :-)
