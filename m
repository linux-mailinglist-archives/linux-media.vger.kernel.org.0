It's too poor randomness, as u64 covers all what in patch 6.

Because it's a common case. You have a value in the register / variable, which
naturally is one of the POD types. Now you want to inject this into bitmap at
the arbitrary offset. Value itself also needs to be variadic size in bits.

Basically what he is trying to achieve is something like bitfield.h API over
bitmaps. Dunno, if actually bitfield.h in the certain driver wouldn't be
enough.

I think it's a case, see above.
