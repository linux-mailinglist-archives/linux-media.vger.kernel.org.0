What I am thinking is who would use a basic RC algorithm in the kernel?
We are designing a toy algorithm which all hardware could use, while it 
would introduce a complex structure to make the userspace work with it.

Vendor would need to try to fit their model in an interface with limited 
functions.

It sounds like a fixed bitrate RC. Then this RC algorithm would in 
charge of selecting the reference frames?

Suppose we are talking about Hantro H1 which people here are familiar with.
An intra frame would usually cost the most hardware time to encode and 
contribute a lot to the size of a GOP(fixed bitrate).

If we ignore the inter frame, that would lead to a bad quality image.
One case here is decide whether I would use a previous intra frame as 
the reference or just the last frame
Userspace should be able to decide when to request a intra frame or 
reencode the current inter frame to intra frame.

I don't think it would help. Fence is a thing for DRM/GPU without a queue.
Even with a fence, would the video sink tell us the motion delta here?

I think we should not restrict how the userspace(vendor) operate the

I don't even think we should write the slice header into the CAPTURE 
buffer, which would cause a cache problem. Ususally the slice header 
would be written only when that slice data is copy out.
That is much more easily that userspace wrapper handle this.
