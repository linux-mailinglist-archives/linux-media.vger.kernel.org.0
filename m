I wouldn't say it's *the* standard way. There are at least several differen=
t
ways driver subsystems handle resource ownership. And even so: the fact tha=
t
something's done a lot does not make it automatically correct.

I disagree. For some reason, you're defending a suboptimal programming
interface. I'm all for reference counting but mixing reference-counted data
with non-counted is simply not a good idea. An API should be easy to use an=
d
hard to misuse. Given the amount of issues, this approach is definitely eas=
y
to misuse.

I'm advocating for a hard split between the subsystem data (reference-count=
ed)
and driver data (living from probe() until remove()). A logical struct devi=
ce
managed entirely by the subsystem should live in a separate structure than
driver data and be allocated - and freed - by the subsystem module.

Let's put aside kernel code for a minute and work with an abstract C exampl=
e,
where the equivalent of what you're proposing would look like this:

struct bar {
	struct foo foo;
	...
};

struct bar *bar =3D malloc(sizeof(*bar));

ret =3D foo_register(&bar->foo);

And the corresponding free() lives who knows where because foo_register()
automagically introduces reference counting (nevermind the need to calculat=
e
where bar is in relations to foo).

I strongly believe that this makes more sense:

struct bar {
	...
};

struct bar *bar =3D malloc();

struct foo *foo =3D foo_register(bar);

// foo is reference counted and allocated in the provider of foo_register()

foo_put(foo);
free(bar);

The equivalent of which is moving struct device out of struct i2c_adapter.
In fact: I would love to see i2c_adapter become a truly reference-counted
object detached from driver data but due to it being embedded in every bus
driver data structure it realistically won't happen.

No, it's not that simple. The .release() callback of struct device embedded
in struct i2c_adapter is assigned from the bus type and only calls complete=
()
(yeah, I too don't think it looks right, one would expect to see the associ=
ated
kfree() here, right?). It relies on the bus driver freeing the data in its
remove() path. That's why we wait until all references to said struct devic=
e
are dropped. After your proposed change, if your new release() lives in the
driver module, it must not be removed until all the references are dropped
- basically where we are now. If on the other hand, the release() callback'=
s
functionality is moved into i2c-core, how would you handle the fact i2c_ada=
pter
can be embedded in a larger driver data structure? Provide yet another call=
back
in i2c_adapter called from the device's .release()? Sure, can be done but I
doubt it's a better solution.
