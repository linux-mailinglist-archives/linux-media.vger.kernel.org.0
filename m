In practice, in stateful decoder, we pace the consumption of input buffers,
otherwise we just endup consuming the entire video into a ring buffer, whic=
h
makes operation like seeks quite heavy and cause CPU spikes.

That being said, I'm not sure how useful a list would be for bitstream buff=
ers.
At the moment, in my current work, I'm leaving buffers in the ready queue, =
and
just tagging the one I have already copied into the ring buffer. And I remo=
ve
them from the ready list, when the related data has been decoded. This is w=
hen I
actually copy the timestamp from src to dst buffer. So in short, I don't us=
e an
extra list, but use some marking on the buffers though, to remember which o=
ne
have already been copied. This is specific to ring buffer based codecs of
course.

The one where a second list helps is for display picture buffers.=C2=A0When=
 a buffer
has been filled, if its in the ready queue, I currently remove that buffer =
and
put it in a custom list. It will then be removed when/if the firmware decid=
es to
display it. It may also never be displayed, and reused by the firmware. I s=
hort,
these are the frame "owned" by the firmware and containing valid pixels. Th=
e rdy
list contains free pictures buffers, and the pixels are undefined.

Maybe, and I'm ready to try, I could also leave them in ready queue and opt=
 for
marking and a counter. As I'm using a job_ready() function, its my driver t=
hat
decides if a device_run() should be executed or not. So what matters is
basically if there is a free buffer for a new decode operation, and a count=
er of
filled but not displayed buffer could probably do that.

Encoders have 3 set of buffers, despite m2m having two queues. OUTPUT buffe=
rs
are the pictures, there is a set of internal reconstruction buffers, and fi=
nally
the CAPTURE buffers are the bitstream. Bitstream buffers are subject to
reordering, so conceptually the firmware holds more then 1, and reconstruct=
ion
buffers are completely hidden.
