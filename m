Indeed, that seems odd given its not on probe. So yet another possible
si2168 bug. Or another way to put it: your cache calls are not needed
if you remove that si2168_init() if init was not called yet. So simply
extending the data structure for the driver and seting a bool flag to
true if init was called should do the trick.

Then the two cache calls would not be needed.

OK well that is expected.

It is not clear to me what this means. Can you clarify?

OK.. I still don't get it, so let me see if we can decipher what you
mean here.

If the firmware is *not* present for the si2168 driver and the device
has *not* been used yet you get a system freeze which you cannot recover
from, but only if you are *not* using a driver which also caches its
firmware already?

In this case if the nouveau is used this freeze does not happen, and you
believe this is because of at least one fetch for the directory is done
already. If so, then this speedup of a fugure negative dentry lookup on
btrfs seems like an interesting test case for btrfs developers too look
at.

But we must first undersand the case well.

OK cool. Thanks for ruling this out!

Looks good to me, except now that you metion the resuem thing, I think
you can drop those patches if you do the check I mentioned on resume,
ie, to verify that init hasn't been called yet.

Also, might as well rename that function to make it clearer what it does
as init prefixed or postfixed calls tend to be used for things during
initialization.

There is a sliver possibility here that a negative dentry slowdown may
cause a btrfs freeze on suspend easily. If so that can likely be fixed
before that big general filesystem freeze issue I noted with URLs and
talks. But I think we need to confirm that is what is happening here.
