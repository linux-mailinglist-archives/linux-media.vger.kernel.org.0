As the totalram default isn't correct for all heaps (or necessarily
even most heaps), so those heaps would need to implement the callback.

I'm just not sure adding complexity to the framework to address this
is useful. Instead of an additional check in the allocation function,
heap implementers will need to assess if the default logic in a
framework is correct, and then possibly implement the callback.

My worry is that without seeing these vendor heaps, this is a bit of a
theoretical concern. We don't have the data on how common this is.
I very much hope that vendors can start submitting their heaps
upstream (along with drivers that benefit from the heaps). Then we can
really assess what makes the most sense for the community maintained
code.

So, as a rule, the upstream kernel doesn't create/maintain logic to
accommodate out of tree code.

Now, I agree there is the potential for some duplication in the checks
in the allocation logic, but until it affects the upstream kernel,
community maintainers can't really make an appropriate evaluation.

As a contra-example, if the allocation is some extreme hotpath, adding
an extra un-inlinable function pointer traversal for the size callback
may actually have a negative impact. This isn't likely but again, if
we cannot demonstrate it one way or the other against the upstream
tree, we can't figure out what the best solution might be.

I think this is the best solution for now. As this is not part of an
userland ABI, we can always change it in the future once we see the
need.
