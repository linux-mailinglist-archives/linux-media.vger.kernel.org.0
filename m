Don't be scared, it's not that difficult :-) A very basic feedback loop
is easier to implement than the code that configures the pipeline and
tracks buffers.

It's easy to create a test tool to demonstrate that the driver works
fine, when the purpose of the test tool is to exercise the driver API in
the way intended by the driver author. What such a test tool fails to
demonstrate is the fitness of the API for real uses cases. This is why
KMS requires userspace APIs to be exercised in a real display stack
(X.org, Weston, Android hwcomposer, ...) and not just in a test tool.
We're following the same rationale here.
