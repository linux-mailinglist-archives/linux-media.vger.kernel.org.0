Thanks for the URL.

Looking at the code, I wouldn't have guessed this is an API for cameras if
I hadn't been told so. I expect changes, possibly major changes, in the API
as well as the underlying framework will be needed for upstreaming. The
exact API toward user space that is required to make use of the camera
related hardware doesn't seem to be there, nor there seem to be any
in-kernel API for exchanging information between drivers.

Having said that, I don't want to judge this too harshly (e.g. without
documentation that supposedly will be written?) at this point as it is not
meant for upstream review yet. Drivers for actual hardware would tell more,
too.
