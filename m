Yes the request API seems like a good fit for this. Note that the returned
sequence number in dequeued buffers for the capture and meta video devices
should match though, so userspace still has a way to know which captured bu=
ffer
used parameters from which meta params buffer.

I think this is pretty much what happens already.

Understood!

Yes I was wondering what would happen in that case. I'll drop the ctrls
handling in the next iteration then.
