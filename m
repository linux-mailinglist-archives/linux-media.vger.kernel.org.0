Perhaps returning -EINVAL on is_cow_mapping() at mmap time. Either that 
or allowing MIXEDMAP.

IIRC the page cache was implemented because of the slowness of the 
caching mode transition itself, more specifically the wbinvd() call + 
global TLB flush.

Yes, I guess that was the issue that the comment describes, but the 
issue wasn't there with vm_insert_mixed() + VM_MIXEDMAP.

Hmm, both 5.11 and drm-tip appears to still use MIXEDMAP?
