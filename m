Or simpler OFC:

	if (!test_bit(DMA_FENCE_FLAG_ENABLE_SIGNAL_BIT, &fence->flags)) {
		WARN_ON_ONCE(!fence->ops->enable_signaling);
		return false;
	}

You could also run this core change past i915 CI to see if it catches anything. Just send to our trybot and see what happens? With the debug option enabled of course. Hope it won't be painful.
