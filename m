The driver could ask the SRAM provider all that info (gen_pool_avail()).
The driver should at runtime determine the amount of SRAM it needs and
only then attempt to allocate the amount it needed. (and free it after
it is done too)

There is no need to hardcode the amount we think our usecase will need
into DT. Sure it may fail to get as much as it wants if we don't carveout
some out up front, but that is true for any memory allocation. Let's not
turn DT into a static memory allocator tool..

Our use of "memory-region" for remote proc memory was also a questionable
thing to do IMHO. Something we will have to cleanup at some point. Might be
good to not call too much attention to that :)
