Hi all,

We organized a Media Summit on Monday June 26th in Prague. It is held
at the Holiday Inn close by the conference centre where the Embedded
Open Source Summit is held (1).

Holiday Inn Prague Congress Centre - Meeting room "E"
Na Pankr√°ci 1684/ 15, 140 00 Praha 4-Nusle
https://www.ihg.com/holidayinn/hotels/us/en/prague/prgnp/hoteldetail

We have room for about 20 people, so let me know if you plan to attend
in person. That way we know how many people we'll get.

Regarding remote participation: only if there is really no other way.
Meeting face-to-face once a year is important IMHO, and attending remotely
is a poor substitute. That said, if it is really necessary to set something
up, then I can do the same I did in Dublin, setting up a Webex meeting.
That worked reasonably well, except that I will need to bring a better
speaker since I learned that the laptop speaker was pretty bad.

If you do want to participate remotely, please let me know as well.

I'll post a separate email with the draft Agenda for the media summit.

Hope to see you all in Prague!

Regards,

	Hans
