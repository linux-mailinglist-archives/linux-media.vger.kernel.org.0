Yes the concern is something else here (sorry for my poor English). It was 
not my intention to contradict you :) 

The concern for "locality" here is that if the variable is shared between 
different functions there are cases where we cannot use kmap_local_page().
For example, those mappings with kmap_local_page() are per thread and CPU 
local.

I think that the best means to convey what I want to express is pointing to 
my patch to Documentation/vm/highmem.rst:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220412124003.10736-1-fmdefrancesco@gmail.com/

I hope that this can help to understand why we care of "locality" in this 
specific case where we use kmap_local_page().

Again, sorry for not being clear.
