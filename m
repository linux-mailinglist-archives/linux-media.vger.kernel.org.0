The main problem with that type of design is the limitations of
TrustZone memory protection. Usually there is a limit to the number of
regions you can define for memory protection (and there is on
Mediatek). So you can't pass an arbitrary memory region and mark it
protected/unprotected at a given time. You need to establish these
regions in the firmware instead and then configure those regions for
protection in the firmware or the TEE.
