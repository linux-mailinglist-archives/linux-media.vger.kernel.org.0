No, because datasheet could call it "xvclk_clk_clk_clk" and it is not a
reason to use it in the bindings. All of these are clocks, so don't add
unnecessary suffixes. The same goes to interrupts (wake not wakeirq) or
DMA (tx not txdma).

Then please do not develop on an older kernel.

Bindings describe the hardware and they are used in different projects.
Let's say Linux implementation supports only 450 MHz, but other project
supports 450 and 900, so your bindings would be incorrect in such
case... IOW, bindings should not depend on the implementation.

What is more, the driver might get updated without updating the comments
in the bindings making them incorrect even for Linux.

In the past several bindings contained actual specifics of
implementation, but this is usually not the proper way.

There are clear issues with describing implementation in the bindings,
but what are the benefits?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
