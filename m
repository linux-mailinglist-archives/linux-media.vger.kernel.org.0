	RFC

	I don't have a good name for this yet and I did not spend
	any time on documentataion (for that reason)

We create fences (out fences) as part of operations execution, which
are short-lived objects, we want to release all memory after operation
execution is completed or when operation gets cancelled/deleted via
ioctl().

This creates a bit of a problem. DMA fences are refcounted objects and
exporter never knows when importer imports a fence or puts its refcount,
so exporter never knows when fence will be destoyed, which should not
be a problem for refcounted objects, but here comes the twist...

	operation A - creates and exports out fence X
	... user-space imports fence X
	operation A - finishes execution, signals fence X
	kfree operation A, put dma_fence

DMA fences are designed to borrow spinlock that DMA fences use to
protect struct dma_fence members:

	struct dma_fence {
	        spinlock_t *lock;

	        const struct dma_fence_ops *ops;
		.....
	};

	void dma_fence_init(struct dma_fence *fence,
			const struct dma_fence_ops *ops,
			spinlock_t *lock,
			u64 context,
			u64 seqno);

So the `lock` should have at least same lifespan as the DMA fence
that borrows it, which is impossible to guarantee in our case. When
we kfree operation A struct we also kfree ->lock that operation
lends to DMA fence, which outlives operation A (depending on what
fence importers do and when they drop imported fence refcount).

This patch adds a new memnber to struct dma_fence: __lock_inplace.
Which is a lock that DMA fence will use to protect its own data when
it cannot reliably borrow a lock from the outside object.

I also had a patch that puts inplace and borrowed locks to an unnamed
uninon and adds one more dma_fence_flag_bits to distinguish between
fences with borrowed and inplace locks

	struct dma_fence {
		uninon {
			spinlock_t *lock;
			spinlock_t __lock_inplace;
		};
		...
	};

And then instead of locking/unlocking ->lock directly we would use
dma_fence_lock_irqsave()/dma_fence_unlock_irqrestore() macros which
would check fence flags and either use borrowed lock or inplace lock.
But after seeing how owten drivers directly access fence ->lock I
decided to scratch that approach and just add extra spinlock member.
