struct vb2_queue.mem_ops

int (*queue_setup)(struct vb2_queue *q,unsigned int *num_buffers, unsigned int *num_planes, unsigned int sizes[], struct device *alloc_devs[]);

From vb2_queue.alloc_devs

What I did now is likes what MFC does, create some mem_alloc_devs.
It would be better that we could retrieve the DMA-heaps’ devices from kernel, but that is not enough, we need a place to store the heap flags although none of them are defined yet.

From Android documents, I think it is unlikely we would have heap flags.
“Standardization: The DMA-BUF heaps framework offers a well-defined UAPI. ION allowed custom flags and heap IDs that prevented developing a common testing framework because each device’s ION implementation could behave differently.”

Because “each DMA-BUF heap is a separate character device”.
But as I said in the first draft I am not sure about the DMA mapping part. alloc_devs responds for the heap, we have a device variable in the queue that mapping function could access, but that may not be enough. A plane may apply a different mapping policy or IOMMU here.

Would it be better that I create a interface here that creating a memdev with DMA-heap description ?
