Look chief, I do understand your frustration here, with the seemingly
arbitrary naming etc. I'm apologise if using the word "ridiculous" earlier
pissed you off. I'm sure you can similarly understand why we don't want
to accept either having a compatible for the rk3066-cif in the file,
when you are not yet sure of the correct constraints, or given your
interest in naming, why calling it after something that it does not even
document is misleading.
Ultimately, I don't care what the file ends up being called when there
are multiple devices documented in it. I'd ack a patch renaming to the
=C5=93riginal incarnation of the IP when the documentation for that IP is
added without a second thought.
