Done,Â  sent as new post to the linux-media list. I messed up one
subject line, 2/1 instead of 1/2.

Also, I made a another change (as per Antti's recommendation):
instead of piggybacking the magic value on the ts_mode variable,
define own boolean flag and use that when this special si2168
mode is needed.
