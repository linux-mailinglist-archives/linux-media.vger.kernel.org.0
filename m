This is fine from my POV. Splitting the the common functionality also
touched a significant part of the venus driver in a pretty bad way.

Again, this is a question of the platform backend part. Nobody
questions that newer platforms have their own driver interface.
We are not asking your team to add if(new) { foo; } else { bar; }
conditions all over the code. Instead we have been asking to split all
platform specifics to the 'backend'. Compare this with mdp4, mdp5 and
dpu backends of the single drm/msm frontend. Or with a similar
approach found in other DRM drivers. Adding new driver is frequently
unjustified, instead the existing driver gets extended to support
different generations.

Another approach, which might also be fine, if that looks better from
your point of view. The current venus driver might have issues with
the internal interfaces. Or it might be not suitable for the backends.
In this case, can we please get older platforms also supported by the
iris driver? This will be a very simple case then: the old deprecated
driver, being phased out and removed, and a new one, which is being
phased in.

The problem is very simple from my side. I do not want to end up in a
situation where we have to change platform code for both drivers if
there is any common issue. Neither would I like for venus and iris
bindings to diverge more than necessary. And as you have seen from my
comments, the iris bindings already do not follow the venus example.
