Can we tell if this control is needed from userland? There's no great
point in filling it in if the driver isn't going to use it.

num_entry_points is a useful field  (in the slice header preferably) for
the RPi hardware as whilst it doesn't need to know the offsets it does
need to construct a table with one entry per offset (for cabac state
purposes) so it needs to know how many there are. It is possible to
infer the number from the slice_segment address in the next slice header
but that involves keeping around more state from one request to the
next.

Yes slice_segment_data only occurs afer slice_segment_header (7.3.6.1)
and that ends with byte_alignment().
