That would work to fix the issue with vsp1, but I don't think it's
enough. See below.

For devices that can absolutely not work with less than two buffers,
setting the minimum to 2 is fine. That is however not the majority use
case, and that's why setting the default in the vb2 core, overriding all
the drivers that haven't been patched, doesn't sound like a good idea to
me.

Generally speaking, 2 is in many cases too low. In the common use case
of capture and display, you will need a minimum of 3 buffers. Use cases
are the responsibility of userspace, we shouldn't try to be too smart
here.

I actually want to lower the number of buffers and require camera
drivers to support operating with a single buffer as a general rule.
Drivers that hold on the last buffer until a new one is provided are
very painful to use, they're causing issues with libcamera.
