Yeah the idea to sort this out was to have symlinks in sysfs from the
device to each heap. We could then have priorities for each such link, so
that applications can pick the "best" heap that will work with all
devices. Or also special links for special use-cases, like for a
display+render drm device you might want to have separate links for the
display and the render-only use-case.

I think trying to encode this all into the name of a heap without linking
it to the device is not going to work well in general.

We still have that entire "make sysfs symlinks work for dma-buf heaps" on
our todos, and that idea is almost as old as dma-buf itself :-/
