Two observations:

as per the description of register 0x3008

3008 default value = 0x02
3008[7] = Software Reset
3008[6] = Software Power Down

The init_settings[] register table has these entries at the very
beginning

	{0x3008, 0x82, 0, 5}, {0x3008, 0x42, 0, 0},

and ends with the entry you have modified

        {0x3008, 0x02, 0, 5}

As I read from the 2.8 section of the datasheet

A reset can also be initiated through the SCCB interface by setting
register 0x3008[7] to high.

So I presume the first two registers entries:

	{0x3008, 0x82, 0, 5} -> Start a SW reset and wait 5 msec
                                for the chip to resume
	{0x3008, 0x42, 0, 0} -> SW standby mode

SW standby mode is described as:

        Executing a software standby through the SCCB interface
        suspends internal circuit activity but does not halt the
        device clock. All register content is maintained in standby
        mode.

I presume that the first

	{0x3008, 0x42, 0, 0}

 exists from SW standby mode to program the chip and the last

        {0x3008, 0x02, 0, 5}

puts the chip in sw standby at the end of init_settings[].
Software standby is then exited by ov5640_set_stream_dvp() for DVP and
by clearing 0x300e[4:3] in MIPI mode, as the datasheet reports:

        To initiate hardware standby mode, the PWDN pin must be tied to high
        (while in MIPI mode, set register 0x300E[4:3] to 2â€™b11 before the PWDN
        pin is set to high)

My second observation is that those entries in the init_settings[]
table performs SW reset/standby regardless if there's a GPIO or not
installed to control the reset and pwdn lines.

Would it be worth in your opinion trying to modify ov5640_power()
and ov5640_reset() to use either SW or HW standby/reset conditionally
on the avialability of sensor->reset_gpio and sensor->pwdn_gpio and
remove the initial SW standby/reset from init_setting[] ?
