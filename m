Just a reminder that we will code review the API first, the supporting
implementation will just be companion. So in this context, the sooner the b=

for an RFC here.

Maybe we need to have a discussion about kernel side GOP management first ?
While I think kernel side rate control is un-avoidable, I don't think state=

encoder should have kernel side GOP management.

My expectation for stateless encoder is to have to specify the frame type a=

the associate references if the type requires it.

We have had a lot more consistent results over the last decade with statele=
ss
hardware codecs in contrast to stateful where we endup with wide variation =
in
behaviour. This applies to Chromium, GStreamer and any active users of VA
encoders really. I'm strongly in favour for stateless reference API out of =
the
Linux kernel.

No, its a lot harder for users. The placement of keyframe should be bound t=
o
various image analyses and streaming conditions like scene change detection=
,
network traffic, but also, I strictly don't want to depend on the Linux ker=
nel
when its time to implement a custom reference tree. In general, stateful de=
coder
are never up to the game of modern RTP features and other fancy robust
referencing model. I overall have to disagree with your proposed approach. =
I
believe we have to create a stateless encoder interface and not a completel=
y
abstract this hardware over our existing stateful interface. We should take
adventage of the nature of the hardware to make simpler and safer driver.

This is incorrect. Any frames can be marked as long term reference, it does=
 not
matter what type they are. From what I recall, marking of the long term in =
the
bitstream is using a explicit IDX, so there is no specific rules on which o=
ne
get evicted. Long term of course are limited as they occupy space in the DP=
B.=20
Also, Each CODEC have different DPB semantic. For H.264, the DPB can run in=
 two
modes. The first is a simple fifo, in this case, any frame you encode and w=
ant
to keep as reference is pushed into the DPB (which has a fixed size minus t=
he
long term). If full, the oldest frame is removed. It is not bound to IDR or=
 GOP.
Though, an IDR will implicitly cause the decoder to evict everything (inclu=
ding
long term).

The second mode uses the memory management commands. This is a series if
instruction that the encoder can send to the decoder. The specification is =
quite
complex, it is a common source of bugs in decoders and a place were statele=
ss
hardware codecs performs more consistently in general. Through the commands=
, the
encoder ensure that the decoder dpb representation stay on sync.

Be aware that "slots" is a hardware implementation detail. I think it can b=
e
used for any MPEG CODEC, but be careful since slots in AV1 specification ha=

completely different meaning. Generalization of slots will create confusion=
.

There is something in that fact that makes me think of Hantro H1. Hantro H1=
 also
have a second reference, but non one ever use it. We have on our todo to
actually give this a look.

Thanks for letting us know. Our assumption is that a second hardware design=
 is
unlikely as Google was giving it for free to any hardware makers that wante=

In general, we diverge on the direction we want the interface to be. What y=
ou
seem to describe now is just a normal stateful encoder interface with every=
thing
needed to drive the stateless hardware implemented in the Linux kernel. The=
re is
no parsing or other unsafety in encoders, so I don't have a strict no-go
argument for that, but for me, it means much more complex drivers and lesse=
r
flexibility. The VA model have been working great for us in the past, givin=
g us
the ability to implement new feature, or even slightly of spec features. Wh=
ile,
the Linux kernel might not be the right place for these experimental method=
s.

Personally, I would rather discuss around your uAPI RFC though, I think a l=
ot of
other devs here would like to see what you have drafted.
