He, indeed, my mistake, although the encoder works more or less fine even
without the full flush so I didn't catch that.

I'll add those two

yes, I need to remove the pm_runtime_get_if_in_use call in the 'flush_all' func
I see there is also a patch for that in the mt8195 v3 series "[PATCH v3 13/33] iommu/mediatek: Remove the power status checking in tlb flush all"

So I'll send v2, adding all those 3 patches, but I think adding mtk_iommu_tlb_do_flush_all
on patch 9 and removing it again on patch 13 is confusing so I'll avoid that.

Thanks,
Dafna
