My understanding is that when you switch to secure mode, the driver makes
some optee calls to set everything up. And userspace needs a way convert a
dmabuf fd to a 'secure handle', which appears to be the DMA address of the
buffer. Who uses that handle?

In any case, using a control to switch to secure mode and using a control
to convert a dmabuf fd to a secure handle seems a poor choice to me.

I was wondering if it wouldn't be better to create a new V4L2_MEMORY_ type,
e.g. V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF_SECURE (or perhaps _DMABUF_OPTEE). That ensures that
once you create buffers for the first time, the driver can switch into secure
mode, and until all buffers are released again you know that the driver will
stay in secure mode.

For converting the dmabuf fd into a secure handle: a new ioctl similar to
VIDIOC_EXPBUF might be more suited for that.

Note that I am the first to admit that I have no experience with secure
video pipelines or optee-os, so I am looking at this purely from an uAPI
perspective.
