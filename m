No, the driver will never be doing the decryption.

It's encrypted using CENC (Common Encryption). The method for
acquiring the keys to perform the decryption is Widevine specific
(Widevine is the Digital Rights Management system we are using...but
nothing in the kernel patches dictates which Digital Rights Management
system is used, but the encryption technique is a standard).
