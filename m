That shouldn't be a problem, though, because if pm_runtime_get_sync()
returns an error, PM-runtime is not going to work for this device
until it is explicitly disabled for it and fixed up.

The point is that pm_runtime_put_noidle() is *sufficient* to drop the
reference and nothing more is needed in the error path.

So you can always do something like this:

ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
if (ret < 0) {
        pm_runtime_put_noidle(dev);
        return ret;
}

However, it would not be a bug to do something like this:

        ret = pm_runtime_get_sync(dev);
        if (ret < 0)
                goto rpm_put;

        ...

rpm_put:
        pm_runtime_put_autosuspend(dev);

So Documentation/power/runtime_pm.rst says this:

  `int pm_runtime_get_sync(struct device *dev);`
    - increment the device's usage counter, run pm_runtime_resume(dev) and
      return its result

In particular, it doesn't say "decrement the device's usage counter on
errors returned by pm_runtime_resume(dev)", so I'm not sure where that
expectation comes from.
