Decryption takes place before the decoder. I suspect there is no dedicated
driver for that, the TEE driver API is similar to smart card API and fits w=
ell
this task. So the decrytor consume normal memory that is encrypted and is o=
nly
allowed to decrypt into secure memory. All this is happening before the dec=
oder,
so is out of scope for this patchset.

Just a correction :-D.

Just to clarify a bit, and make sure I understand this too. You are proposi=
ng to
introduce something like:

   V4L2_MEMORY_SECURE_DMABUF

Which like V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF is meant to import dmabuf, while telling the
driver that the memory is secure according to the definition of "secure" fo=
r the
platform its running on.

This drivers also allocate secure SHM (a standard tee concept) and have int=
ernal
allocation for reconstruction buffer and some hw specific reference metadat=
a. So
the idea would be that it would keep allocation using the dmabuf heap inter=
nal
APIs ? And decide which type of memory based on the memory type found in th=
e
queue?

Stepping back a little, why can't we have a way for drivers to detect that
dmabuf are secure ? I'm wondering if its actually useful to impose to all
userspace component to know that a dmabuf is secure ?

Also, regarding MTK, these are stateless decoders. I think it would be nice=
 to
show use example code that can properly parse the un-encrypted header, pass=
 the
data to the decryptor and decode. There is a bit of mechanic in there that =
lacks
clarification, a reference implementation would clearly help. Finally, does=
 this
platform offers some clearkey implementation (or other alternative) so we c=
an do
validation and regression testing? It would be very unfortunate to add feat=
ure
upstream that can only be tested by proprietary CDM software.
