Correct, there are no rooms available during the conference.

It's also why I wouldn't announce the meeting since I have no idea
where we can meet and how many people would fit in whatever place
we'll find.

It might be that when we get to the venue it turns out that there are
many areas where you can have an informal meeting, or it might be
a lot more difficult.

If it turns out to be easy to find a space for this, then it can be announced
during the libcamera talk. We'll find out on the Monday.

Regards,

	Hans
