Generally speaking, fewer headaches for people trying to support Linux
on Intel client platforms.

Every system that needs to be put into dmi_ignore_port_nodes[] means a
boot problem for someone that needs to be addressed.

And after the Hans' patch at

https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-acpi/patch/20240612104220.22219-=
1-hdegoede@redhat.com/

we would effectively get very close to that point anyway.

Are the ACPI tables on MTL and beyond going to be fixed?  If not,
we'll probably need to add MTL to the list of platform IDs and so on.
In what way is this better?
