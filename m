Ah, I was not aware of that. In that case leave it as-is. Same for the compatible
string. Personally I think it is a bit too vague, but that ship has sailed...

Perhaps I phrased it badly. The DV Timings API isn't a separate API, it is just a
set of V4L2 ioctls specifically created to handle digital video inputs (HDMI, DP,
VGA, DVI, etc.) where the video signal can go away (unplugged), and come back, and
change resolutions on the fly. It relies on the V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE to signal
to userspace when the resolution changes.

The basic operation is that the hardware detects the timings (and also whether there
is a video signal at all), and if the video signal/timings change it will raise the
event and (if streaming is in progress) call vb2_queue_error() to stop further streaming.

Userspace sees the event, it will stop streaming and call QUERY_DV_TIMINGS to get the new
timings (if any). When it gets the new timings it will call S_DV_TIMINGS. S_DV_TIMINGS will
also update the format, so afterwards G_FMT will return an updated format using the new
width and height.

The reason for all this is that you cannot change resolutions on the fly since there is
a whole pipeline that depends on the resolution: buffer sizes (of course), but also
how the captured frames are used in userspace, etc. So a resolution change will typically
require a complete rebuild of the video pipeline.

Whether S_DV_TIMINGS needs to change anything in the hardware depends on the hardware
itself. It will always update the current format. In the case of this driver that is likely
the only thing it needs to do.

Note that the driver should always have some initial default timings. Typically 1080p60
is chosen. The internal timings structure is just what was last set (or the initial default),
and S_DV_TIMINGS updates it. It does not need to match what the hardware detects.

Only QUERY_DV_TIMINGS reports what the hardware sees, but that ioctl will never change
the driver state, it just reports what is detected.

There are also a number of controls that relate to DV_TIMINGS API, see the V4L2_CID_DV_TX_*
controls: https://hverkuil.home.xs4all.nl/spec/userspace-api/v4l/ext-ctrls-dv.html

You will likely want to support V4L2_CID_DV_RX_POWER_PRESENT and V4L2_CID_DV_RX_RGB_RANGE,
assuming the hardware can report this.

I really need to start documenting this properly in our spec. Let me see if I can come
up with an initial patch for this.

This driver is used for a specific use-case, and it is one for which it is fine
to put in a default EDID. But, if you do so, then you should make sure you use
an EDID that passes the edid-decode checks.

It also has to match the hardware capabilities.
