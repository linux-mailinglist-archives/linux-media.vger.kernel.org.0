I could send dmesg output, but aside from the fact that it's almost
1000 lines, I have just had a moderate degree of success.  Using the
pci=noacpi kernel option, gives me:

[    1.767176] ite_cir: Auto-detected model: ITE8708 CIR transceiver

[    1.840881] input: ITE8708 CIR transceiver as /devices/virtual/rc/rc0/input3
[    1.844915] ite_cir: driver has been successfully loaded

So after a couple of weeks, I should be happier, right?  Never seen
any of these lines before.  I am happy that there's progress, but some
things still aren't right.

1.  The kernel option will be used to focus my debugging efforts.  At
least this seems to support the idea that ACPI plays a role in this.
I was beginning to lose faith in that idea.
2.  Since the device seems to be recognized by the system, I thought
I'd take a quick stab at seeing if it recognized a remote.  No matter
the protocol, the remote, or distance, neither ir-keytable or ir-ctl
(thanks for that tool!) wanted to register any signals.  So far I'm
chalking that up to the previous point.  Maybe it's possible that
communication is still hampered, even though the device can be
identified.  Sort out PCI, and maybe things start rolling.  I know the
receiver works, since I confirmed that with a test install of Windows
10 early on in this process.

Thanks for taking the time Sean.  I know you've got a lot of other
things on the go, so I really do appreciate it.
