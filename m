On SoCs you probably get a kernel configuration that is missing some 
feature but still boots up when you do not select/depend on the exact 
controller, but in the case of the mgb4 PCIe card you get a driver that 
does not work at all (The SPI_XILINX dependency could theoretically be 
made configurable, but you would lose the ability to flash the correct 
FW for the current HW module and the access to the card's serial number. 
I2C and XDMA are crucial.).

My motivation when using "select" was to help people using "make 
menuconfig" to get the module selected/configured as they will usually 
not know that there are some Xilinx IP cores used that need separate 
drivers and the menuconfig GUI simply hides the mgb4 option making it 
almost impossible just from the menus to find out what has to be selected.

But when there are reasons, why to chose "depends on" (like various 
configurations, tests or the "readability" of the dependencies) than I'm 
ok with your patch proposal.
