Yeah, I had that in mind for a while too. I think it would be valuable,
but it's difficult as it is already so I didn't tackle it at first :)

The format negociation especially seems to divert quite a lot from what
i915 and vc4 have been doing, and that's user facing to some extent.

I had the latter in mind, but I haven't really tried to reconcile the
connector state output_format with the
drm_atomic_helper_bridge_propagate_bus_fmt, and plug in the output_bpc
count too.

We would have to create the max_bpc properties from the HDMI connector,
and then propagate that upstream along the bridges I guess (or we can
just ignore it for now).

So, yeah, I had the latter in mind but it might turn out that the former
is actually easier. Both make sense to me at least.
