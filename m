Yeah, that indeed makes much more sense.

When existing drivers want to avoid their own handling and move their 
memory management over to using DMA-heaps even for internal allocations 
then no objections from my side. That is certainly something we should 
aim for if possible.

But what we should try to avoid is that newly merged drivers provide 
both a driver specific UAPI and DMA-heaps. The justification that this 
makes it easier to transit userspace to the new UAPI doesn't really count.

That would be adding UAPI already with a plan to deprecate it and that 
is most likely not helpful considering that UAPI must be supported 
forever as soon as it is upstream.

Please try to avoid stuff like that it is really confusing and eats 
reviewers time.

Christian.
