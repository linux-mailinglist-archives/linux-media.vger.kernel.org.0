Note that for properties that only depend on the sensor model, we could
keep a database of sensors in userspace instead of pushing all that to
the kernel. We could in theory do the same for the pixel array size and
other related sizes, but as V4L2 already expose those, I would prefer
using the V4L2 API to query them.

The whole point of black pixels is that they can be captured (or at
least part of them), for the ISP to calculate an average black level and
subtract it from the active pixels. Let's thus make sure we clearly
define every selection rectangle in the specification.
