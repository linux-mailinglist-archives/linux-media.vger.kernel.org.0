We should probably start documenting that better.

Yeah, that's why I designed P2P that way :)

I also don't think it's that bad, at least for radeon, nouveau and 
amdgpu all the migration restrictions are actually handled correctly.

In other words when a DMA-buf is about to be used by another device we 
use TTM to move the buffer around so that it can actually be accessed by 
that device.

What I haven't foreseen in here is that we need to deal with different 
caching behaviors between exporter and importer.

Well that explains this, I've joined the party a year later and haven't 
witnessed all of this.

Or reject the attachment. As far as I can see that is still the cleanest 
option.
