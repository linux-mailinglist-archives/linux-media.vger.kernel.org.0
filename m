I *think* that Sebastian have identified how to detect when the self reset =
is
not sufficient (and I guess the same may exist in LibreELEC tree). As the
failure is not fatal, and it will recover if you let the codec idle for a
little, I don't have any argument to make this a hard blocker.

But before we unstated with this known issue, I'd like to see this well
documented, and ideally see a kernel warning whenever that state is reached=
.
From there, it will be easy to justify a more invasive change to reset the
entire block. It may also help identify when getting user reports of issues=
.
