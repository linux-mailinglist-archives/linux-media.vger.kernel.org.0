As noted earlier, there's a dependency to the source media bus format. That
needs to be specified in order to come up with the pixelformat that the
device can actually produce. This is not really a problem with driver
implementation but the lack of an API to get this done.

Also, this isn't specific to omap3isp either: any device where the capture
format depends on pipeline configuration has the same issue.

Since no better solutions have been suggested, I'd be in favour of
extending ENUM_FMT to cover MC-enabled drivers by using one of the reserved
fields for the source media bus code.
