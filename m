Hi Nicolas,

Thanks for you useful answer!

Yeah indeed I think there's a distinction between selecting a profile that
allows 422 and ensuring that this is what the encoder selects. Not sure if =
420
is always valid for any profile, but there's surely some overlap where both
could be selected in compliance with the profile.

Sounds good then.

Agreed. I'm just a bit worried that it's a bit late to change the semantics=
 now
that the source crop is defined in the stateful encoding uAPI and its meani=
ng
would become unclear/different when a destination crop is added.
