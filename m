You do not expect to see it for output devices. Those will typically use
VIDIOC_ENUMSTD or VIDIOC_ENUM_DV_TIMINGS. VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES is something
that only makes sense for output devices if they do not support ENUMSTD or
ENUM_DV_TIMINGS, i.e. it has some very odd output hardware. In particular
vivid doesn't support this for the emulated video output.

I don't think v4l2-compliance has a check for this. I think it should at
least issue a warning if the video output devices supports ENUM_FRAMESIZES
and also ENUMSTD or ENUM_DV_TIMINGS.

In any case, qv4l2 shouldn't crash, so an initial fix should be to check
for m_frameSize being 0. A patch is welcome.

Which driver is this? I assume it is an out-of-tree driver, since I am
not aware of any mainline drivers that do this.

Regards,

	Hans
