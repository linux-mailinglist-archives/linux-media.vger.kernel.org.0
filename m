I'm pretty (but not 100%) sure the initial report in that ticket were
issues caused by a backport of a patch that was reverted later:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230609082238.3671398-1-mchehab@kernel.org/

The versions when the problems started and some feedback in the ticket
when things started working again (like
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=217566#c15 â€“ 6.3.9 was when
the revert came to 6.3.y) are strong indicators for that.

But yes, more people showed up in the ticket with problems that might or
might not be related to the initial problem and things got confusing. I
told them to report those problems separately. Ideally somebody would
look into that and check if they did, yes, but I chose to ignore things
at that point, as regression tracking is quite hard already and I have
to draw lines somewhere. I often hate that, but otherwise I don't get
much work done. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
