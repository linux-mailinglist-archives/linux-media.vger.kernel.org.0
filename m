I really hope we'll provide a solution much faster than that :-)

PipeWire is becoming the de facto media server on desktop systems, for
both audio and video. It has been shipped by distributions for a while
for audio, and is the core component that allows screen capture (and
therefore screen sharing in video conferencing) on Wayland-based
systems. For video, PipeWire support has most notably been integrated in
WebRTC, used by both Firefox and Chrome. The number of applications
using PipeWire is growing, OBS has recently received support for
PipeWire sources for instance. If you need to use it in an application
that requires a V4L2 capture device, the pw-v4l2 script emulates the
V4L2 API to provide a quick stopgap measure until applications get
native PipeWire support.

libcamera solves an orthogonal problem, which is control of raw camera
sensors and ISPs typically found in mobile and embedded devices, and now
increasingly in laptops as well (Intel IPU3, IPU4, IPU6 and IPU7).
Applications typically don't use libcamera directly, but interface it
with GStreamer (libcamerasrc element) or PipeWire (which has native
libcamera support).

While I understand that libcamera and PipeWire may be quite new for a
large number of users, the ecosystem is moving in that direction, and
both projects are very active.
