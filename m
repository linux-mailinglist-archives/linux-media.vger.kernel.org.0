Hi Adam,

so now we need to figure our on how to handle HCI_VENDOR_PKT.

#define LL_RECV_VENDOR \
	.type = HCI_VENDOR_PKT, \
	.hlen = aaa, \
	.loff = bbb, \
	.lsize = ccc, \
	.maxlen = ddd

static const struct h4_recv_pkt ll_recv_pkts[] = {
	...
	{ LL_RECV_WAKE_ACK,  .recv = ll_recv_frame  },
	{ LL_RECV_VENDOR,    .recv = hci_recv_diag  },
};

Can you hexdump the data inside the skb and we can figure out what it uses for the header and size.

In hci_bcm.c there are a few examples of fixed size packets and bpa10x.c contains one where it follows an actual header definition. Also hci_nokia.c contains a few for their packets.

Regards

Marcel
