Yes, the accounting of buffers at runtime on production devices is
part of the use case:

Why is this patch a hack? We found a problem with the initial design
which nobody saw when it was originally created, and now we're trying
to address it within the constraints that exist. Is there some other
solution to the problem of exports getting blocked that you would
suggest here?

The use case was described in the commit message when the feature was
initially added (after discussion about it on the list) including
links to code that uses the feature:
