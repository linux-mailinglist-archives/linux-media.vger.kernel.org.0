I think that is not actually a problem.  At least for how it works on
arm64 but I'm almost positive x86 is similar.. I'm not sure how else
you could virtualize mmu/iommu/etc in a way that didn't have horrible
performance.

There are two levels of pagetable translation, the first controlled by
the host kernel, the second by the guest.  From the PoV of host
kernel, it is just memory mapped to userspace, getting faulted in on
demand, just as normal.  First the guest controlled translation
triggers a fault in the guest which sets up guest mapping.  And then
the second level of translation to translate from what guest sees as
PA (but host sees as VA) to actual PA triggers a fault in the host.

it is just mapping host VA to the guest.. the guest kernel sees this
as the PA and uses the level of pgtable translation that it controls
to map to guest userspace.  *All* that is needed (which this patch
provides) is the correct cache attributes.

This is basically what happens, although via the two levels of pgtable
translation.  This patch provides the missing piece, the caching
attributes.

Changing the attributes dynamically isn't going to work.. or at least
not easily.  If you had some sort of synchronous notification to host
userspace, it could trigger an irq to the guest, I suppose.  But it
would mean host kernel has to block waiting for host userspace to
interrupt the guest, then wait for guest vgpu process to be scheduled
and handle the irq.

At least in the case of msm, the cache attributes are static for the
life of the buffer, so this scenario isn't a problem.  AFAICT this
should work fine for at least all UMA hw.. I'm a bit less sure when it
comes to TTM, but shouldn't you at least be able to use worst-cache
cache attributes for buffers that are allowed to be mapped to guest?
