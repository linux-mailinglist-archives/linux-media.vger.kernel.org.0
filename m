That's my concern too. Imagine an object moving in the top-down
direction in front of the sensor. With rolling-shutter sensors, the
object will appear stretched vertically if the sensor is mounted
upside-up, and squashed if the sensor is mounted upside-down. This may
be important information for applications.

For the imx258 and ov02a10, existing users that have the ability to take
flip controls or the sensor rotation controls into account, but not
both, may be affected. Users that take neither controls into account, or
all of them, should be fine. I thus don't expect regressions. For ccs,
we may need to check more carefully.
