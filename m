I known the Hantro can't do this. While such design is not unusal. HW 
could tell we can't CU that we could do inter predict from one previous 
reconstruction frame, then it is not necessary to have it in its RPS.

I don't think Hantro H1 would do that.

We are driving away vendor participation. Besides, the current design is

I am not talking about mapping the register to the userspace.
The userspace would generate a register set for the current frame, while 
the kernel should fill that register set with buffer address and trigger 
the hardware to apply the register.

Generating a register set from control or even fill partial slice header 
cost many resources.

And what we try to define may not fit for real hardware design, you 
could only cover the most of hardwares would require but not vendor 
didn't have to follow that. Besides, codec spec could be updated even 
after it has been released for a while.

Android hates peoploe allocating a huge of memory without 
userspace's(Android's core system) awareness.

Whether a reconstruction frame would be used for long term reference(or 
golden frame) is complete up to userspace decision. For example, when we 
encoding a part of SVC layer 1, we may not reference to a frame in layer 
0, should we let the hardware discard that? Later, we may decide to 
refernce it again.

Besides, I don't like the timetstamp way to refer a buffer here, one 
input graphics buffer could produce multiple reconstruction buffer(with 
different coding options), which is common for SVC case.

Macroblock level QP control in Hantro H1 is very useful. For FOSS, those 
vendor special statistic or controlling may not be necessary, while the 
real product is not simple.
