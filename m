Ah, I see why the diff.txt didn't apply: there is some TAB to space mangling going on.

Make sure your editor preserves TAB characters and doesn't replace them by spaces.

I tried it again - it appears I mistakenly included the last line that says "(END)" and maybe you just need to remove it? I included an ancestor file in the zip. With that, a three-way merge can be done (left, right, ancestor, merge result) where left and right are my file and your file and ancestor is the one I used when creating my file and is an ancestor to both my file and your file (actually, I think it is your file since you haven't made changes recently).

This is a problem for architectures/compilers/calling conventions that push a different number of bytes on the stack for these different sized parameters (vaargs) of the *printf type variadic functions. Do such architectures/compilers/calling conventions exist?

I'll look a bit more into this. gcc handles this fine, but I'll see what I can do.

> 
> The SwitchResX EDID is included to show how it uses the "GP ASCII String Block (0Bh)" DisplayID block. You already have a Dell UP2715K EDID, but you're missing two of the three variants (there is two for dual cable DisplayPort input and one for Mini DisplayPort). I'm not sure which variant this modified EDID belongs to. I do have this display. I can get the EDIDs if you still want them.

Yes please.

> The Acer XV273K has two DisplayPort ports. The EDIDs show a different "Source physical address" for each in the CTA block. The Acer has a dual cable 4K 144Hz mode selectable from the onscreen display menu which modifies the EDIDs for the two DisplayPort ports and adds a "Tiled Display Topology Block (12h)" block to each. I did not include the EDID for the HDMI port. The numbers 2,3,5,6 are used to make the file names unique. They come from the order the EDIDs were loaded by my EDIDUtil script. https://gist.github.com/joevt/32e5efffe3459958759fb702579b9529

Differences in the Source physical address are normal between inputs and can be ignored. So I need only one.

> 
> The LG UltraFine 5K (v2) is also a dual cable display. Therefore, each EDID has a "Tiled Display Topology Block (12h)" block. The two DisplayPort 1.2 signals arrive via Thunderbolt 3. The v2 has a different product ID (5b74) than the v1 (5b11). The v2 uses the Titan Ridge Thunderbolt 3 controller so it can accept USB-C DisplayPort alt mode input for 4K resolution. I don't know if there's a USB-C single cable EDID - it could be the same as one of the Thunderbolt EDIDs.

On the other hand, the Acer XV273K and Dell UP3218K have menu options to switch between inputs, therefore the EDIDs of the second input of the display are similar to the EDIDs of the first input of the same display (the Acer has one inexplicable difference in the YCbCr 4:2:0 Capability Map Data Block).

From those files, it appears to be able to support dual cable 5K and 6K resolutions. I wonder how that will appear in the EDID (EDIDs in the macOS override files don't include tiled timings and topologies). It might be the first display to have two different tile sizes. It has multiple refresh rates for the tiled modes like the Dell UP3218K.

What on earth does a negative horizontal backporch value mean? I've never seen that.

<vendor>-<model>-<input type>

So: lg-32ud99-w-dp, samsung-ue48ju7090-hdmi, etc.

All lower case.

In any case, my original comment remains: please split this up in multiple patches.
This patch is too big to review. There is some good things in here, esp. the DisplayID 2.0
additions (this was on my own TODO list).

Regards,
