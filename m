Hi Paul,

Similar with Hantro H1.

Userspace already know that the driver will be downsample through the selec=
ted
profile. The only issue would be if a users want to force a profile with 42=
2
support, but have its  422 data downsampled anyway. This is legal in the sp=
ec,
but I'd question myself if its worth supporting.

Yes, for the cases not covered by the profile, I'd consider a control to fo=
rce
downsampling. A menu, so we can use the available menu items to get enumera=
te
what is supported.

Yes, we should use selection on both queue (fortunately there is a v4l2_buf=
_type
in that API). Otherwise we cannot model all the scaling and cropping option=
s.
What the spec must do is define the configuration sequence, so that a
negotiation is possible. We need a convention regarding the order, so that =
there
is a way to converge with the driver, and also to conclude if the driver ca=
nnot
handle it.

We might find extra corner case by implementing the spec, but I think the A=
PI we
have makes most of this possible already. Remember that we have fwht sw cod=
ec in
kernel for the purpose of developing this kind of feature. A simple bob sca=
ler
can be added for testing scaling.
