M2M transfers are not a hardware-specific API, and such kind of
transfers is not new either. Old media devices like bttv have
internally a way to do PCI2PCI transfers, allowing media streams
to be transferred directly without utilizing CPU. The media driver
supports it for video, as this made a huge difference of performance
back then.

On embedded world, this is a pretty common scenario: different media
IP blocks can communicate with each other directly via memory. This
can happen for video capture, video display and audio.

With M2M, most of the control is offloaded to the hardware.

There are still time control associated with it, as audio and video
needs to be in sync. This is done by controlling the buffers size 
and could be fine-tuned by checking when the buffer transfer is done.

On media, M2M buffer transfers are started via VIDIOC_QBUF,
which is a request to do a frame transfer. A similar ioctl
(VIDIOC_DQBUF) is used to monitor when the hardware finishes
transfering the buffer. On other words, the CPU is responsible
for time control.

On other words, this is still real time. The main difference
from a "sync" transfer is that the CPU doesn't need to copy data
from/to different devices, as such operation is offloaded to the
hardware.
