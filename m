Hi Sakari,

That's what we need to decide :-)

We now have

    * - ``V4L2_CTRL_FLAG_DYNAMIC_ARRAY``
      - 0x0800
      - This control is a dynamically sized 1-dimensional array. It
        behaves the same as a regular array, except that the number
        of elements as reported by the ``elems`` field is between 1 and
        ``dims[0]``. So setting the control with a differently sized
        array will change the ``elems`` field when the control is
        queried afterwards.

that allows changing a control size dynamically from userspace. It only
works for 1D controls though. The kernel can also change the dimensions
of a control at any time, and that could be done when the HDR control
would be set to dual-gain mode to turn the gain controls into arrays.

That's what we need to decide :-) I'm tempted to go for a single control
that would cover both the multi-channel and multi-gain needs.

V4L2_CID_ANALOG_GAIN control would become an array control of two
elements, one for T1 and one for T2. It may confuse some applications.
For new drivers that could be fine. For existing drivers, an application
that sets the control as if it were a regular V4L2_CID_ANALOG_GAIN of
type V4L2_CTRL_TYPE_INTEGER would break.

This may be fixable in the V4L2 control framework, by only allowing
get/set of a subset of an array control. I'm not sure that't desirable
in the general case though. If the control dimensions were changed by
the driver when turning dual-gain mode on (or off) we would only need (I
think) to update v4l2_s_ctrl() to allow writing array controls when the
array contains a single element, which should be less of a problem.

For the digital gains, V4L2_CID_DIGITAL_GAIN would become a 2D array,
with one dimension covering the colour channels, and the other dimension
covering the T1/T2 gains.
