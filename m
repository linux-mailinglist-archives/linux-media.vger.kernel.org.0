Right, we had two controls for exposure indeed. I think there could be
drivers that use V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE with another unit. Worth checking
perhaps. Either way, we could add that unit to the documentation of the
V4L2_CID_EXPOSURE as a recommendation or a requirement.

The unit of the new control would need to be pixels.

Agreed. The locking could be moved from drivers to the framework, but it
wouldn't be a trivial task. As of now, the framework does not provide
locking for sub-device nodes.

Right now, I guess I'd just use what the sensor transmits on the bus, and
ignore what's inside. We don't have a way to report the rest to the user
space anyway, and that generally would only have a very slight impact on
timing.

Feel free to keep it as-is if it works with the redundant DT properties
removed.

Please switch to use of_device_id table and the compatible string.
