OK so how do you know that other firmware is not getting loaded or cached?

Other than checking kernel logs you can rm -rf /lib/firmware/ and then
only place the files you want to test.

OK so if you install the firmware files of si2168 you do run into a
freeze, and this freeze happens on resume from suspend?

Without the si2168 firmware the freeze does not happen.

Is that right?

OK this statement is clear and is very different from the one I made
above.

But note, that this is true, how are you *sure* that no other firmware
other than nouveau is being used? What about wifi? or bluetooth?

OK this is only if and only if you haven't used the si2168 device,
right? And since this is related to si2168 we know that even if you
don't use the si2168 device its function which calls to load firmware
*does* get called on resume, even though that same function was not
called on probe, as the device is not used.

If true, then the race to freeze here happens on resume against btrfs.

And is the firmware present or not in this case, in which the freeze
happens?

OK perfect, now the next question to clarify is *are you sure* that no
other firmware is used, other than si2168 and nouveau?

This helps, thanks so much, now we'll have to write a reproducer, thanks
for the report!!

Let's confirm first whether or not your system is using other firmware
files too or not.
