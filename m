In v2 I have remove the structure and only keep a dynamic v4l2 control (an array
of integer). Control num_elems could be used as num_entry_points field.
Userland can test if the driver implement the control to decide to fill or not.
It is already the case in GStreamer for Hantro dedicate control.

I have done a patch for that change in v2.
