My goal is not to proactively support proprietary drivers, and I don't
know how to measure such incentive or risk, when it comes to video
drivers.

And besides there is e.g. FUSE.

While I get this argument isolated, it does not match the observed
reality, and does not provide tools to address the core issue. I
will be in my grave before I've fixed the world like you are
suggesting :-)

Like, first off, where would I use libcamera or Pipewire? There's
no well-defined target other than kernel in this problem.

I'd look at the usage patterns in the field too. It is pretty obvious
that there is a significant gap what users want and expect when it
comes to this debate.
