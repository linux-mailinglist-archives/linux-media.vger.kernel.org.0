It's worse: pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range() takes pinctrldev_list_mutex, but
in the loop it calls pinctrl_match_gpio_range() which calls
mutex_lock(&pctldev->mutex). So it's two mutexes that this function takes from
what is supposed to be atomic context.

In addition, pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range() is called from pinctrl_gpio_direction(),
which also takes pctldev->mutex afterwards.

I'm not sure if the pctldev->mutex can be replaced with rcu, I suspect not.

For something that's supposed to be atomic, there seem to be an awful lot of mutexes...

In the case of the bcm2711 the bcm2835_gpio_direction_output() function calls
pinctrl_gpio_direction_output, which in turn (via pinctrl_gpio_direction()
and pinmux_gpio_direction()) calls bcm2835_pmx_gpio_set_direction().

It appears to me that bcm2835_gpio_direction_output() can call
bcm2835_pmx_gpio_set_direction() directly, thus avoiding all the mutexes.
That's exactly what samsung/pinctrl-samsung.c and qcom/pinctrl-msm.c do,
from what I can tell.

Are pinctrl drivers supposed to call pinctrl_gpio_direction_output() from
the direction_output() op? Isn't that perhaps the bug?
