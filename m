Yes, anything apart from the bayer/generic data modes, internally
everything is converted into 32-bit YUVA/RGBA pixels (according to the
Reference Manual, 37.4.2.3 FCW & FCR). That is represented by the
MEDIA_BUS_FMT_AYUV8_1X32 media bus format at the CSI source pads.

That is done in the IDMAC, which can write any supported YUV format from
the internal YUV pixels (if not in bayer/generic data mode).

You should also be able to store the YUV formatted pixels as NV12, NV16,
YUYV, etc.

Ack.

I think that statement is limited to the parallel 16-bit interface in
hsync/vsync mode, whereas in bt.656 / bt.1120 mode the interface
operates as if the two components were clocked in as two separate 8-bit
(or 10-bit) values.

That sounds good to me.
