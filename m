We just need a method to indicate where the hardware could write its 
slice data or compressed frame.
While we would decided which frame that the current frame should refer, 
the (some) hardware may discard our decision, which reference picture 
set would use less bits. Unless the codec supports a fill up method, it 
could lead to a gap between header and frame data.

Things likes profile, level or tiers could be reused. It make no sense 
to expose those vendor special feature.
Besides, profile, level or tiers are usually stored in the sequence 
header or uncompressed header, hardware doesn't care about that.

I think we should go with the vendor registers buffer way that I always 
said. There are many encoding tools that a codec offer, variants of 
hardware may not support or use them all. The context switching between 
userspace and kernel would drive you mad for so many controls.

DPB is the only thing we need to decide any API here under the vendor 
registers buffer way. We need the driver to translate the buffer 
reference to the address that hardware could use and in its right registers.

The major problem is how to export the reconstruction buffer which was 
hidden for many years.
This could be disccused in the other thread like V4L2 ext buffer api.

Such rate control or quailty report would be complete vendor special.
We just need a method that let driver report those encoding statistic to 
the userspace.
