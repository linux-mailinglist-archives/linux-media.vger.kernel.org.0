I don't know how widespread the IPU that I have is, I assume that some 
other tablets & 2in1 devices that are a few years old use it as well. 
For me it would be definitely nice to have this driver. However, I can 
ask around in some of the forumsÂ  if there is a wider interest. Might be 
a niche tough, but the support for the Atom device I use have been 
greatly improved in the recent years. So there is at least some work 
going on for that platform (I do not know, but I think it is called 
cherry trail?). As there are many older reports of problems with audio, 
touchscreen, stability (freezes) ... and none of them are present anymore.

As mentioned, if the development is hindered by missing hardware I would 
be glad to help. Anyhow - many thanks for your replies, much appreciated!
