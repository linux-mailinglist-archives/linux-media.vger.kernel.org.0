Just FYI, proper fixes tag usage is described here:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html

Hence in this case it should look like this:

Fixes: 1c35ba3bf972 ("media: si2157: use a different namespace for
firmware")

At this point it likely would be good to submit a v2 of the patch with
that Fixes tag, the Tested-by tag from Robert, the CC for stable
backports, and Link: tags linking to all known reports about this
problem (also described in above document), e.g. like this:

Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215726
Link:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/5f660108-8812-383c-83e4-29ee0558d623@leemhuis.info/

Ciao, Thorsten (wearing his 'the Linux kernel's regression tracker' hat)

P.S.: As the Linux kernel's regression tracker I'm getting a lot of
reports on my table. I can only look briefly into most of them and lack
knowledge about most of the areas they concern. I thus unfortunately
will sometimes get things wrong or miss something important. I hope
that's not the case here; if you think it is, don't hesitate to tell me
in a public reply, it's in everyone's interest to set the public record
straight.
