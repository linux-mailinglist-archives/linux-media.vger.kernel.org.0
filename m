I mean the latter, but I have to say that the spec doesn't make it clear
if TGT_NATIVE_SIZE equals the active area or also includes inactive pixels.

What exactly does Android expect?

I don't think so.

The crop bounds defines the outer bounds of the area where you can put
your crop rectangle. This can very well include areas where the pixels
are covered and so always return black (sometimes used to obtain black
levels, I believe).

The default crop rectangle would be the one that reports the active
area. The native size rectangle would be the full pixel array.

So CROP_DEFAULT <= CROP_BOUNDS <= NATIVE_SIZE.

For a cross-shaped sensor I would expect that the CROP_BOUNDS/DEFAULT
depends on the format (aspect ratio).

I think this makes sense.

The specification definitely needs to be improved, patches are welcome...

Ah, so that's what it is used for :-)

Which of the three targets above would match with what Android needs?
