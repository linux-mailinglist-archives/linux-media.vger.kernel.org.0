Agreed.

Agreed too.

Should "1.25.3.1. Configuration of video capture" be moved to "4.1.
Video Capture Interface", and "1.25.3.2. Configuration of video output"
to "4.3. Video Output Interface" ?

I'm not sure where patch 1/4 should be moved to though. As I mentioned
in the review, I think it should create a section specific to camera
sensors. "4.13. Sub-device Interface" isn't a very good candidate as it
describes the interface, it shouldn't document how particular classes of
subdevs are to be handled. Maybe a new top-level section in "Part I -
Video for Linux API" to describe different types of sub-devices ?
