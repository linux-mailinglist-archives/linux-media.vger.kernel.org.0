IIUC Rafael is referring to uclamp, i.e. scheduler utilization clamping, see:

  https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#cpu

The above describes the cgroup interface, note that you can also set clamps
per task (via sched_setattr()).

One thing that comes to mind however is that schedutil only "sees" the clamps
of runnable tasks, and from reading your changelog you may not have moments
without any (i.e. gears are grinding in HW). You'd have to try boosting
(setting a high uclamp.min) whatever tasks you have on the software side and
see how it all behaves.
