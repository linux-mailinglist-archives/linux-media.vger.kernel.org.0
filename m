Fwiw, I would like the distinction here between optional fences
(writers, readers) and mandatory fences (others). The optional fences
are where we put the implicit fence tracking that clever userspace would
rather avoid. The mandatory fences (I would call internal) is where we
put the fences for tracking migration that userspace can not opt out of.
