True :) The amount of churn on the stating atomisp sensor drivers which
(the few which I have been working on so far) is quite big and that is just
inching them closer to being mainline ready.

Yes my bad I meant to write "not going to scale very well".

I think that having to pass these kinda long lists of registers with
regmap already when you want to use caching (and need to specify volatile
registers which cannot be cached) is a bit of a pain of using regmap (*)

Regards,

Hans


*) Not that I have a better solution for e.g. the volatile registers thing,
it just causes a lot of what feels like boilerplate code
