Not that it matters, the changes I performed only required a Link: tag,
which is how things should have been done for many years already. It
later became Closes: due to patches from Matthieu. But whatever. :-D

That's what I do, unless the reporter granted his permission. To quote
Documentation/process/5.Posting.rst : ```Be careful in the addition of
tags to your patches, as only Cc: is appropriate for addition without
the explicit permission of the person named; using Reported-by: is fine
most of the time as well, but ask for permission if the bug was reported
in private.```

I heard of on instance where a GDPR complaint was filed due to a
Reported-by: tag. So maybe that part should be even revisited reg. the
Cc: aspect. :-/

Ciao, Thorsten
