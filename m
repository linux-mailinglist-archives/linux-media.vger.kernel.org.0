This is unrelated, since the code here generates a bitstream. Some of the
parameters you'd pass with registers with other drivers, are passed with me=
mory
chunk in rkvdec. Not all these blob have a byte aligned memory layout, they=
 are
instead bitstream without any consideration for byte alignment. So we need =
a
tool to create such a bitstream. Similar tool will be needed for adapting
encoders.
