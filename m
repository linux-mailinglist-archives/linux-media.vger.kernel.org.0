Sorry, I was looking at the usb_sg_* calls, those are there if you want
to use them.

But again, why not just use the normal sg field in the urb itself for
the scatter-gather pointer?  Will that not work for you?

The old-style usb-storage driver uses the usb_sg_* calls, and the uas.c
driver uses the sg fields and provides line-speed transfers (the speed
limit is in the device, not the kernel).
