From: Tomasz Figa <tfiga@chromium.org>

Due to complexity of the video encoding process, the V4L2 drivers of
stateful encoder hardware require specific sequences of V4L2 API calls
to be followed. These include capability enumeration, initialization,
encoding, encode parameters change, drain and reset.

Specifics of the above have been discussed during Media Workshops at
LinuxCon Europe 2012 in Barcelona and then later Embedded Linux
Conference Europe 2014 in Düsseldorf. The de facto Codec API that
originated at those events was later implemented by the drivers we already
have merged in mainline, such as s5p-mfc or coda.

The only thing missing was the real specification included as a part of
Linux Media documentation. Fix it now and document the encoder part of
the Codec API.

+*************************************************
+Memory-to-Memory Stateful Video Encoder Interface
+*************************************************
+
+A stateful video encoder takes raw video frames in display order and encodes
+them into a bytestream. It generates complete chunks of the bytestream, including
+all metadata, headers, etc. The resulting bytestream does not require any
+further post-processing by the client.
+
+Performing software stream processing, header generation etc. in the driver
+in order to support this interface is strongly discouraged. In case such
+operations are needed, use of the Stateless Video Encoder Interface (in
+development) is strongly advised.

+
+Querying Capabilities
+=====================
+
+1. To enumerate the set of coded formats supported by the encoder, the
+   client may call :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` on ``CAPTURE``.
+
+   * The full set of supported formats will be returned, regardless of the
+     format set on ``OUTPUT``.
+
+2. To enumerate the set of supported raw formats, the client may call
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT` on ``OUTPUT``.
+
+   * Only the formats supported for the format currently active on ``CAPTURE``
+     will be returned.
+
+   * In order to enumerate raw formats supported by a given coded format,
+     the client must first set that coded format on ``CAPTURE`` and then
+     enumerate the formats on ``OUTPUT``.
+
+3. The client may use :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` to detect supported
+   resolutions for a given format, passing desired pixel format in
+   :c:type:`v4l2_frmsizeenum` ``pixel_format``.
+
+   * Values returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` for a coded pixel
+     format will include all possible coded resolutions supported by the
+     encoder for given coded pixel format.
+
+   * Values returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES` for a raw pixel format
+     will include all possible frame buffer resolutions supported by the
+     encoder for given raw pixel format and coded format currently set on
+     ``CAPTURE``.
+
+4. Supported profiles and levels for the coded format currently set on
+   ``CAPTURE``, if applicable, may be queried using their respective controls
+   via :c:func:`VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL`.
+
+5. Any additional encoder capabilities may be discovered by querying
+   their respective controls.
+
+Initialization
+==============
+
+1. Set the coded format on the ``CAPTURE`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``CAPTURE``.
+
+     ``pixelformat``
+         the coded format to be produced.
+
+     ``sizeimage``
+         desired size of ``CAPTURE`` buffers; the encoder may adjust it to
+         match hardware requirements.
+
+     ``width``, ``height``
+         ignored (read-only).
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``sizeimage``
+         adjusted size of ``CAPTURE`` buffers.
+
+     ``width``, ``height``
+         the coded size selected by the encoder based on current state, e.g.
+         ``OUTPUT`` format, selection rectangles, etc. (read-only).
+
+   .. important::
+
+      Changing the ``CAPTURE`` format may change the currently set ``OUTPUT``
+      format. How the new ``OUTPUT`` format is determined is up to the encoder
+      and the client must ensure it matches its needs afterwards.
+
+2. **Optional.** Enumerate supported ``OUTPUT`` formats (raw formats for
+   source) for the selected coded format via :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT`.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``pixelformat``
+         raw format supported for the coded format currently selected on
+         the ``CAPTURE`` queue.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+3. Set the raw source format on the ``OUTPUT`` queue via
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_FMT`.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.
+
+     ``pixelformat``
+         raw format of the source.
+
+     ``width``, ``height``
+         source resolution.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``width``, ``height``
+         may be adjusted to match encoder minimums, maximums and alignment
+         requirements, as required by the currently selected formats, as
+         reported by :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES`.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * Setting the ``OUTPUT`` format will reset the selection rectangles to their
+     default values, based on the new resolution, as described in the next
+     step.
+
+4. **Optional.** Set the visible resolution for the stream metadata via
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_SELECTION` on the ``OUTPUT`` queue if it is desired
+   to be different than the full OUTPUT resolution.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.
+
+     ``target``
+         set to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP``.
+
+     ``r.left``, ``r.top``, ``r.width``, ``r.height``
+         visible rectangle; this must fit within the `V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS`
+         rectangle and may be subject to adjustment to match codec and
+         hardware constraints.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``r.left``, ``r.top``, ``r.width``, ``r.height``
+         visible rectangle adjusted by the encoder.
+
+   * The following selection targets are supported on ``OUTPUT``:
+
+     ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS``
+         equal to the full source frame, matching the active ``OUTPUT``
+         format.
+
+     ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT``
+         equal to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS``.
+
+     ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP``
+         rectangle within the source buffer to be encoded into the
+         ``CAPTURE`` stream; defaults to ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_DEFAULT``.
+
+         .. note::
+
+            A common use case for this selection target is encoding a source
+            video with a resolution that is not a multiple of a macroblock,
+            e.g.  the common 1920x1080 resolution may require the source
+            buffers to be aligned to 1920x1088 for codecs with 16x16 macroblock
+            size. To avoid encoding the padding, the client needs to explicitly
+            configure this selection target to 1920x1080.
+
+   .. warning::
+
+      The encoder may adjust the crop/compose rectangles to the nearest
+      supported ones to meet codec and hardware requirements. The client needs
+      to check the adjusted rectangle returned by :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_SELECTION`.
+
+5. Allocate buffers for both ``OUTPUT`` and ``CAPTURE`` via
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`. This may be performed in any order.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``count``
+         requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT`` or
+         ``CAPTURE``.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``count``
+          actual number of buffers allocated.
+
+   .. warning::
+
+      The actual number of allocated buffers may differ from the ``count``
+      given. The client must check the updated value of ``count`` after the
+      call returns.
+
+   .. note::
+
+      To allocate more than the minimum number of OUTPUT buffers (for pipeline
+      depth), the client may query the ``V4L2_CID_MIN_BUFFERS_FOR_OUTPUT``
+      control to get the minimum number of buffers required, and pass the
+      obtained value plus the number of additional buffers needed in the
+      ``count`` field to :c:func:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS`.
+
+   Alternatively, :c:func:`VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS` can be used to have more
+   control over buffer allocation.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``count``
+         requested number of buffers to allocate; greater than zero.
+
+     ``type``
+         a ``V4L2_BUF_TYPE_*`` enum appropriate for ``OUTPUT``.
+
+     other fields
+         follow standard semantics.
+
+   * **Return fields:**
+
+     ``count``
+         adjusted to the number of allocated buffers.
+
+6. Begin streaming on both ``OUTPUT`` and ``CAPTURE`` queues via
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON`. This may be performed in any order. The actual
+   encoding process starts when both queues start streaming.
+
+.. note::
+
+   If the client stops the ``CAPTURE`` queue during the encode process and then
+   restarts it again, the encoder will begin generating a stream independent
+   from the stream generated before the stop. The exact constraints depend
+   on the coded format, but may include the following implications:
+
+   * encoded frames produced after the restart must not reference any
+     frames produced before the stop, e.g. no long term references for
+     H.264/HEVC,
+
+   * any headers that must be included in a standalone stream must be
+     produced again, e.g. SPS and PPS for H.264/HEVC.
+
+Encoding
+========
+
+This state is reached after the `Initialization` sequence finishes
+successfully.  In this state, the client queues and dequeues buffers to both
+queues via :c:func:`VIDIOC_QBUF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`, following the
+standard semantics.
+
+The content of encoded ``CAPTURE`` buffers depends on the active coded pixel
+format and may be affected by codec-specific extended controls, as stated
+in the documentation of each format.
+
+Both queues operate independently, following standard behavior of V4L2 buffer
+queues and memory-to-memory devices. In addition, the order of encoded frames
+dequeued from the ``CAPTURE`` queue may differ from the order of queuing raw
+frames to the ``OUTPUT`` queue, due to properties of the selected coded format,
+e.g. frame reordering.
+
+The client must not assume any direct relationship between ``CAPTURE`` and
+``OUTPUT`` buffers and any specific timing of buffers becoming
+available to dequeue. Specifically:
+
+* a buffer queued to ``OUTPUT`` may result in more than one buffer produced on
+  ``CAPTURE`` (if returning an encoded frame allowed the encoder to return a
+  frame that preceded it in display, but succeeded it in the decode order),
+
+* a buffer queued to ``OUTPUT`` may result in a buffer being produced on
+  ``CAPTURE`` later into encode process, and/or after processing further
+  ``OUTPUT`` buffers, or be returned out of order, e.g. if display
+  reordering is used,
+
+* buffers may become available on the ``CAPTURE`` queue without additional
+  buffers queued to ``OUTPUT`` (e.g. during drain or ``EOS``), because of the
+  ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued in the past whose decoding results are only
+  available at later time, due to specifics of the decoding process,
+
+* buffers queued to ``OUTPUT`` may not become available to dequeue instantly
+  after being encoded into a corresponding ``CAPTURE`` buffer, e.g. if the
+  encoder needs to use the frame as a reference for encoding further frames.
+
+.. note::
+
+   To allow matching encoded ``CAPTURE`` buffers with ``OUTPUT`` buffers they
+   originated from, the client can set the ``timestamp`` field of the
+   :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` struct when queuing an ``OUTPUT`` buffer. The
+   ``CAPTURE`` buffer(s), which resulted from encoding that ``OUTPUT`` buffer
+   will have their ``timestamp`` field set to the same value when dequeued.
+
+   In addition to the straightforward case of one ``OUTPUT`` buffer producing
+   one ``CAPTURE`` buffer, the following cases are defined:
+
+   * one ``OUTPUT`` buffer generates multiple ``CAPTURE`` buffers: the same
+     ``OUTPUT`` timestamp will be copied to multiple ``CAPTURE`` buffers,
+
+   * the encoding order differs from the presentation order (i.e. the
+     ``CAPTURE`` buffers are out-of-order compared to the ``OUTPUT`` buffers):
+     ``CAPTURE`` timestamps will not retain the order of ``OUTPUT`` timestamps.
+
+.. note::
+
+   To let the client distinguish between frame types (keyframes, intermediate
+   frames; the exact list of types depends on the coded format), the
+   ``CAPTURE`` buffers will have corresponding flag bits set in their
+   :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` struct when dequeued. See the documentation of
+   :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` and each coded pixel format for exact list of flags
+   and their meanings.
+
+Should an encoding error occur, it will be reported to the client with the level
+of details depending on the encoder capabilities. Specifically:
+
+* the CAPTURE buffer (if any) that contains the results of the failed encode
+  operation will be returned with the V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR flag set,
+
+* if the encoder is able to precisely report the OUTPUT buffer(s) that triggered
+  the error, such buffer(s) will be returned with the V4L2_BUF_FLAG_ERROR flag
+  set.
+
+In case of a fatal failure that does not allow the encoding to continue, any
+further operations on corresponding encoder file handle will return the -EIO
+error code. The client may close the file handle and open a new one, or
+alternatively reinitialize the instance by stopping streaming on both queues,
+releasing all buffers and performing the Initialization sequence again.
+
+Encoding Parameter Changes
+==========================
+
+The client is allowed to use :c:func:`VIDIOC_S_CTRL` to change encoder
+parameters at any time. The availability of parameters is encoder-specific
+and the client must query the encoder to find the set of available controls.
+
+The ability to change each parameter during encoding is encoder-specific, as
+per the standard semantics of the V4L2 control interface. The client may
+attempt to set a control during encoding and if the operation fails with the
+-EBUSY error code, the ``CAPTURE`` queue needs to be stopped for the
+configuration change to be allowed. To do this, it may follow the `Drain`
+sequence to avoid losing the already queued/encoded frames.
+
+The timing of parameter updates is encoder-specific, as per the standard
+semantics of the V4L2 control interface. If the client needs to apply the
+parameters exactly at specific frame, using the Request API
+(:ref:`media-request-api`) should be considered, if supported by the encoder.
+
+Drain
+=====
+
+To ensure that all the queued ``OUTPUT`` buffers have been processed and the
+related ``CAPTURE`` buffers are given to the client, the client must follow the
+drain sequence described below. After the drain sequence ends, the client has
+received all encoded frames for all ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued before the
+sequence was started.
+
+1. Begin the drain sequence by issuing :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENCODER_CMD`.
+
+   * **Required fields:**
+
+     ``cmd``
+         set to ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP``.
+
+     ``flags``
+         set to 0.
+
+     ``pts``
+         set to 0.
+
+   .. warning::
+
+      The sequence can be only initiated if both ``OUTPUT`` and ``CAPTURE``
+      queues are streaming. For compatibility reasons, the call to
+      :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENCODER_CMD` will not fail even if any of the queues is
+      not streaming, but at the same time it will not initiate the `Drain`
+      sequence and so the steps described below would not be applicable.
+
+2. Any ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued by the client before the
+   :c:func:`VIDIOC_ENCODER_CMD` was issued will be processed and encoded as
+   normal. The client must continue to handle both queues independently,
+   similarly to normal encode operation. This includes:
+
+   * queuing and dequeuing ``CAPTURE`` buffers, until a buffer marked with the
+     ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag is dequeued,
+
+     .. warning::
+
+        The last buffer may be empty (with :c:type:`v4l2_buffer`
+        ``bytesused`` = 0) and in that case it must be ignored by the client,
+        as it does not contain an encoded frame.
+
+     .. note::
+
+        Any attempt to dequeue more ``CAPTURE`` buffers beyond the buffer
+        marked with ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` will result in a -EPIPE error from
+        :c:func:`VIDIOC_DQBUF`.
+
+   * dequeuing processed ``OUTPUT`` buffers, until all the buffers queued
+     before the ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP`` command are dequeued,
+
+   * dequeuing the ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS`` event, if the client subscribes to it.
+
+   .. note::
+
+      For backwards compatibility, the encoder will signal a ``V4L2_EVENT_EOS``
+      event when the last frame has been encoded and all frames are ready to be
+      dequeued. It is deprecated behavior and the client must not rely on it.
+      The ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` buffer flag should be used instead.
+
+3. Once all ``OUTPUT`` buffers queued before the ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP`` call are
+   dequeued and the last ``CAPTURE`` buffer is dequeued, the encoder is stopped
+   and it will accept, but not process any newly queued ``OUTPUT`` buffers
+   until the client issues any of the following operations:
+
+   * ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_START`` - the encoder will not be reset and will resume
+     operation normally, with all the state from before the drain,
+
+   * a pair of :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the
+     ``CAPTURE`` queue - the encoder will be reset (see the `Reset` sequence)
+     and then resume encoding,
+
+   * a pair of :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` on the
+     ``OUTPUT`` queue - the encoder will resume operation normally, however any
+     source frames queued to the ``OUTPUT`` queue between ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP``
+     and :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` will be discarded.
+
+.. note::
+
+   Once the drain sequence is initiated, the client needs to drive it to
+   completion, as described by the steps above, unless it aborts the process by
+   issuing :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` on any of the ``OUTPUT`` or ``CAPTURE``
+   queues.  The client is not allowed to issue ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_START`` or
+   ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP`` again while the drain sequence is in progress and they
+   will fail with -EBUSY error code if attempted.
+
+   For reference, handling of various corner cases is described below:
+
+   * In case of no buffer in the ``OUTPUT`` queue at the time the
+     ``V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP`` command was issued, the drain sequence completes
+     immediately and the encoder returns an empty ``CAPTURE`` buffer with the
+     ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag set.
+
+   * In case of no buffer in the ``CAPTURE`` queue at the time the drain
+     sequence completes, the next time the client queues a ``CAPTURE`` buffer
+     it is returned at once as an empty buffer with the ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST``
+     flag set.
+
+   * If :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` is called on the ``CAPTURE`` queue in the
+     middle of the drain sequence, the drain sequence is canceled and all
+     ``CAPTURE`` buffers are implicitly returned to the client.
+
+   * If :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF` is called on the ``OUTPUT`` queue in the
+     middle of the drain sequence, the drain sequence completes immediately and
+     next ``CAPTURE`` buffer will be returned empty with the
+     ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_LAST`` flag set.
+
+   Although mandatory, the availability of encoder commands may be queried
+   using :c:func:`VIDIOC_TRY_ENCODER_CMD`.
+
+Reset
+=====
+
+The client may want to request the encoder to reinitialize the encoding, so
+that the following stream data becomes independent from the stream data
+generated before. Depending on the coded format, that may imply that:
+
+* encoded frames produced after the restart must not reference any frames
+  produced before the stop, e.g. no long term references for H.264/HEVC,
+
+* any headers that must be included in a standalone stream must be produced
+  again, e.g. SPS and PPS for H.264/HEVC.
+
+This can be achieved by performing the reset sequence.
+
+1. Perform the `Drain` sequence to ensure all the in-flight encoding finishes
+   and respective buffers are dequeued.
+
+2. Stop streaming on the ``CAPTURE`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMOFF`. This
+   will return all currently queued ``CAPTURE`` buffers to the client, without
+   valid frame data.
+
+3. Start streaming on the ``CAPTURE`` queue via :c:func:`VIDIOC_STREAMON` and
+   continue with regular encoding sequence. The encoded frames produced into
+   ``CAPTURE`` buffers from now on will contain a standalone stream that can be
+   decoded without the need for frames encoded before the reset sequence,
+   starting at the first ``OUTPUT`` buffer queued after issuing the
+   `V4L2_ENC_CMD_STOP` of the `Drain` sequence.
+
+This sequence may be also used to change encoding parameters for encoders
+without the ability to change the parameters on the fly.
+
+Commit Points
+=============
+
+Setting formats and allocating buffers triggers changes in the behavior of the
+encoder.
+
+1. Setting the format on the ``CAPTURE`` queue may change the set of formats
+   supported/advertised on the ``OUTPUT`` queue. In particular, it also means
+   that the ``OUTPUT`` format may be reset and the client must not rely on the
+   previously set format being preserved.
+
+2. Enumerating formats on the ``OUTPUT`` queue always returns only formats
+   supported for the current ``CAPTURE`` format.
+
+3. Setting the format on the ``OUTPUT`` queue does not change the list of
+   formats available on the ``CAPTURE`` queue. An attempt to set the ``OUTPUT``
+   format that is not supported for the currently selected ``CAPTURE`` format
+   will result in the encoder adjusting the requested ``OUTPUT`` format to a
+   supported one.
+
+4. Enumerating formats on the ``CAPTURE`` queue always returns the full set of
+   supported coded formats, irrespective of the current ``OUTPUT`` format.
+
+5. While buffers are allocated on any of the ``OUTPUT`` or ``CAPTURE`` queues,
+   the client must not change the format on the ``CAPTURE`` queue. Drivers will
+   return the -EBUSY error code for any such format change attempt.
+
+To summarize, setting formats and allocation must always start with the
+``CAPTURE`` queue and the ``CAPTURE`` queue is the master that governs the
+set of supported formats for the ``OUTPUT`` queue.
