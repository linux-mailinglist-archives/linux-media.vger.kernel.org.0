It wasn't clear to me that this was specifically about raw Bayer.

For COLORSPACE_RAW there really is no xfer_func as such. V4L2_MAP_XFER_FUNC_DEFAULT
sets it to NONE for COLORSPACE_RAW, but the documentation for NONE is a bit
misleading since it says that that means linear. For COLORSPACE_RAW is really
means custom. I am wondering if a XFER_FUNC_RAW or _CUSTOM should be introduced
to properly signal this. I am certainly not opposed to that.

The YCbCr encoding will be DEFAULT for Bayer (really, it is ignored, but
it is good practice to set it to DEFAULT in that case). If you DO convert
to YCbCr, then it has to follow some standard.

The quantization range will be FULL for Bayer. Again, something else doesn't
make sense for Bayer.

Bayer frame:
colorspace = RAW
xfer_func = NONE
ycbcr_enc = DEFAULT (ignored)
quantization = FULL

NV12 frame:
colorspace = RAW
xfer_func = NONE
ycbcr_enc = 601 for SDTV, 709 for !SDTV
quantization = LIMITED

RGB frame:
colorspace = SRGB
xfer_func = SRGB
ycbcr_enc = DEFAULT (ignored)
quantization = FULL

JPEG frame:
colorspace = SRGB
xfer_func = SRGB
ycbcr_enc = 601
quantization = FULL

(or you just set colorspace to COLORSPACE_JPEG, which is a shorthand for this)

Perhaps you should describe what your m2m device actually *does*? Ah,
you did at the end :-)

The m2m devices that I know just convert RGB to YUV or JPEG (or vice
versa). In both cases the colorspace and transfer function remain as-is,
so copying these two values from the output pixelformat is the right
thing to do. It's all you have, nobody else can fill it in. Typically
userspace will get this information from the sensor or video receiver.

The process of converting a raw Bayer sensor to something presentable
is something an ISP does, but the end result will have to specify
valid (i.e. non-raw) colorspace/xfer_func/ycbcr_enc/quantization colorimetry,
otherwise nobody will know how to interpret the resulting frame.

Here you request the JPEG pixelformat, so that forces the output
configuration. So no need for any V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_* for this pixel
format.

Here you select a YUV format (NV12 or similar). The default colorimetry
it should select is V4L2_COLORSPACE_SMPTE170M for SDTV and V4L2_COLORSPACE_REC709
otherwise. If you want to allow this to be overridden, then that can be
done with V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE for these two pixelformats.

If userspace selects an unsupported colorspace, then the driver should
pick a supported colorspace (almost certainly you would want V4L2_COLORSPACE_REC709).

So this device does a lot more than most m2m devices: it apparently knows
how to convert the raw Bayer data to a proper picture.

I do wonder if it is really converting correctly to these three colorimetry
permutations. If you give it a test pattern, then save the result in these
three format and visually compare them, do they look identical? If the ISP
really does convert correctly, then you should not be able to see any
difference. There is a clear difference between V4L2_XFER_FUNC_SRGB and
V4L2_XFER_FUNC_709 when seen side-by-side. Note that the difference between
V4L2_COLORSPACE_SMPTE170M and V4L2_COLORSPACE_REC709 is pretty much impossible
to see, they are very close.

That chip can only convert between RGB/YUV and limited/full quantization
range. The colorspace and xfer_func will be whatever is received in the AVI
InfoFrame of the HDMI video stream. So this is a typical example of a
3x3 matrix + vector implementation. It comes with a bunch of default matrixes
(hardcoded and selected by the enum), but I believe it can be manually set
as well. I can't remember if that's done in this driver.

If you want to manually set ycbcr_enc and quantization, then you would
have to specify V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_YCBCR_ENC | V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_QUANTIZATION.

Yes.

I believe the driver predates these additional colorimetry fields.
