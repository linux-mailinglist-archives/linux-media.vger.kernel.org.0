Krzysztof first version had much longer lines, and in facts it has
been asked by me to reduce them to 80 cols. The media subsystem
requires to validate patches with

        ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --strict --max-line-length=80

We longly debated this and I believe it's now generally accepted to go
over 80 when it makes sense, but not regularly span to 120 cols like
in the previous version.

I think this 80-cols limit not being an hard limit anymore is doing
more worse than good, as each subsystem applies a different rule, and
I know how frustrating is for Krzysztof to be pushed in different
direction, as the same happened to me when I contributed to other
subsystems and I've been asked to span to 100 cols while I was trying
to stay in 80 no matter what.

Thanks
