The graph already exists, and can be walked through the media controller
right?

I don't think I understand this one...

How about adding a count in s_stream so that the thread only gets
started when the use count is > 0, and stopped when the usage < 1.

That handles making sure that only one thread is available.

All calls into s_stream() will need to take a lock/mutex to protect /
prevent any action from occurring while the thread is performing a
process of the pipeline.


static int vimc_streamer_thread(void *data)
{
	struct vimc_stream *stream = data;
	u8 *frame = NULL;
	int i;

	set_freezable();

	for (;;) {
		try_to_freeze();
		if (kthread_should_stop())
			break;

+		/* take lock shared with s_stream */

		for (i = stream->pipe_size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
			frame = stream->ved_pipeline[i]->process_frame(
					stream->ved_pipeline[i], frame);
			if (!frame || IS_ERR(frame))
				break;
		}

+		/* Release lock/mutex shared with s_stream

		//wait for 60hz
		set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
		schedule_timeout(HZ / 60);
	}

	return 0;
}



And you'll need to make the code which processes the pipeline aware of
the fact that there may be two pipelines to fulfil:

Pseudo patch/code:

static int vimc_streamer_thread(void *data)
{
-	struct vimc_stream *stream = data;
+	/* Something which knows about the whole device */
+	struct xxxxx *yyy = data;

+	u8 *raw;
	u8 *frame = NULL;
	int i;

	set_freezable();

	for (;;) {
		try_to_freeze();
		if (kthread_should_stop())
			break;

		/* take lock shared with s_stream */

+		/* Process the sensor first */
+		raw = stream->ved_pipeline[sensor]->process_frame(..);
+		error check;

+		/* (If connected) Process stream 1 */
+		if (raw)
+		frame = stream->ved_pipeline[raw]->process_frame();
+		error check;

+		/* If connected process the rest of the pipe */
+		for (i = after sensor; end_entity; i++) {
			frame = stream->ved_pipeline[i]->process_frame(
					stream->ved_pipeline[i], frame);
			if (!frame || IS_ERR(frame))
				break;
		}

		/* Release lock/mutex shared with s_stream

		//wait for 60hz
		set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
		schedule_timeout(HZ / 60);
	}

	return 0;
}



I may have missed something as the original loop was decrementing and
going backwards through the entities in stream->ved_pipeline.

I guess splitting that all out so instead it starts at the sensor, and
just walks the graph (handling any running/connected fork to two
entities appropriately) in a neater way would be another option rather
than hardcoding it, but either way the thread needs to operate at the
device level rather than the stream level.
