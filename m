I'm a bit confused :)
Sorry.

Plan is to replace a common pattern.
First I switch to alvium_read(alvium, reg, value, err); implementation.
Then I switch to this macro that is not really safe :)

Do you have some hint? :)
Thanks in advance.

Maybe I haven't catch completely your comments.

Thanks & Regards,
Tommaso
