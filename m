My point is: we can't use amdgpu_vm_ready() to replace vm_is_busy(), so
currently we update vm even when vm is busy. So why not use:
if (!amdgpu_vm_ready() || vm_is_busy()) return;
in amdgpu_gem_va_update_vm(), as you mentioned we prefer to not
update vm when it's idle.

As above, this confuse me as we can explicitly check vm idle when
user update vm, why bother to embed it in evicting flag implicitly?

Check vm idle need to hold resv lock. Read your patch for adding
evicting flag is to update vm without resv lock. But user vm ops in
amdgpu_gem_va_update_vm() do hold the resv lock, so the difference
happens when calling amdgpu_vm_bo_update_mapping() from
svm_range_(un)map_to_gpu(). So embed vm idle in evicting flag
is for svm_range_(un)map_to_gpu() also do nothing when vm idle?
