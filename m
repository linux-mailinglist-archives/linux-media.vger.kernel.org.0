Porting my atomisp-ov2680.c changes should get us close to having the standard ov2680.c work on the miix510 (ACPI enumeration, runtime-pm and selection API support will all be added).

I had a tree that "worked" in that you could stream with it but it was very ugly, as I had no idea what I was doing at the time and swiftly got the Surface instead and so moved on to that. The references to OV2680 in the CIO2/INT3472 code are hangovers from that early support really.

>>> I have recently bought a second hand miix 510. Long story short: Can you give me some quick instructions, or a docs pointer for testing a new sensor with libcamera ?Â  Or preferably I guess first outside of libcamera just grabbing raw-bayer + some userspace debayer tool for testing and then later on test under libcamera ?
>>
>> Outside of libcamera is a case of configuring the formats and then grabbing frames from the CIO2's devnode, then queuing those frames to the IPU3's input devnode. The easiest way to do it is using the ipu3 utils within the libcamera project, which don't actually use the library itself but rather just configure with media-ctl and capture with yavta. See [1] and [2] for example. Testing within libcamera requires that the driver meet libcamera's requirements [3] which mostly means ensuring it has the 5 mandatory controls, plus some targets for the .get_selection() callback - I can't remember exactly which ones but I think it's CROP, NATIVE_SIZE, CROP_BOUNDS and CROP_DEFAULT. And I think it would also need an entry adding right at [4] to describe the sensor for libcamera. After that the cam tool from libcamera should list it with cam -l and capture from it with cam -cN --capture, or alternatively qcam would display the stream.

Yep, I saw that and agree with it - I'll drop that patch and raise another for the sensor driver.
