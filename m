In the doc-comment I said: "Handling of application's offsets is
driver-dependent, application must use the resulting buffer offset."

This can be made stricter using a new
V4L2_BUF_FLAG_USE_CAPTURE_MPLANE_DATA_OFFSET, for example. But then it
doesn't feel good anymore to me because output buffers don't require a
special flag, hence it feels inconsistent.

There is another variant with adding new data_offset fields to the
v4l2_plane_pix_format and then will be possible to set data offsets
using VIDIOC_S_FMT for both S/MPLANEs, assuming that we won't need more
than 3 offsets for SPLANEs. But this is a much more invasive and
questionable UAPI extension.

The root of the problem is that DRM UAPI is more flexible and allows to
customize offsets for both S/MPLANEs, while V4L doesn't allow to do it
at all. I'm exploring all the potential options, so far neither of the
proposed variants is ideal.
