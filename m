Subject: [PATCH v4 22/52] docs: get rid of :c:type explicit declarations for structs
Date:   Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:24:45 +0200
Message-Id: <f74a2b4e1c8c475b5a053f5edd9da5a818be4b1f.1601467849.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-media@vger.kernel.org

The :c:type:`foo` only works properly with structs before
Sphinx 3.x.

On Sphinx 3.x, structs should now be declared using the
.. c:struct, and referenced via :c:struct tag.

As we now have the automarkup.py macro, that automatically
convert:
	struct foo

into cross-references, let's get rid of that, solving
several warnings when building docs with Sphinx 3.x.
