We've discussed this previously on IRC, but I don't think the issue has
been raised on the list.

I'm puzzled by how this will work. As far as I understand, the RK3568
has a CSI-2 receiver with 4 data lanes and 2 clock lanes. I assume this
is used to support both 2x2 lanes and 1x4 lanes. Both the VICAP and ISP
sections of the TRM list CSI2 RX registers, but it's not clear how the
components are all connected. Does the ISP need to be part of the same
media graph ?
