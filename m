8bpc RGB is in fact mandatory.

Ideally I'd like to know the actual color depth of the panel
independently of the supported signal color depths. Unfortunately
I don't think EDID gives us that. Can't recall if DisplayID might
have something a bit more sensible.

Given how info->bpc works right now, I suppose it would make sense
to bump it up to 12 when 4:2:2 is supported. But I've not thought
through the actual implications such a change.

Since 8bpc RGB must always be supported this looks
like dead code to me.
