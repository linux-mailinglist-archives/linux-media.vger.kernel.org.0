We're exactly on the same page. The only solution [*] I can see for this
problem is to get the Windows drivers to use the same ACPI data as the
Linux drivers.

* Another solution would be for OEMs to stop caring about Windows and
testing their machines with Linux only, essentially reversing the
current situation. Chances of this happening however seem even tinier
:-)
