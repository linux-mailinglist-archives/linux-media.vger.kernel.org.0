Hm is that code merged already in upstream already?

I know that dma-buf looks really generic, but like I said if there's no
need ever to interface with any of the gpu buffer sharing it might be
better to use something else (like get_user_pages maybe, would that work?).

You need to annotate all the code involved in signalling that dma_fence
using dma_fence_begin/end_signalling, and then enable full lockdep and
everything.

You can safely assume you'll find bugs, because we even have bugs about
this in gpu drivers (where that annotation isn't fully rolled out yet).

The tldr is that you can allocate memory in there. And a pile of other
restrictions, but not being able to allocate memory (well GFP_ATOMIC is
ok, but that can fail) is a very serious restriction.
