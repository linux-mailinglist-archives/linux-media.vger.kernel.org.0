Hi, I'd like to resurrect this thread (copied above). I have a system 
showing this error. Its a HP ML350 server with 2x Xeon 5675 running 
Rocky Linux 8.5. It has a Hauppauge HVR5525 card that uses the same 
cx23885 kernel module as the quadHD card discussed above. The HVR5525 is 
a dual DVB-T2/DVB-S2 card.

In other threads I read about the dma_reset_workaround option. That 
option did not appear to be in the version included in standard kernel 
in Rocky 8.5. I have loaded a 5.4 kernel and compiled the DVB media 
modules from .git source and set dma_reset_workaround=2 in a file in 
modprobe.d. The built module shows version 0.0.4

Sadly the error remains. The system runs MythTV v.31. The main symptom 
is occasional aborted recordings. Although the card does appear to 
recover, not requiring a reboot/cold restart.

I'd appreciate some assistance with this. What information can I provide 
to help to trace this.

Many thanks

Ken
