I missed adding this sentence to the cover letter, as my impression was that
dma-buf-map was already used outside inter-driver framework. But there
is actually a cover letter:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220126203702.1784589-1-lucas.demarchi@intel.com/

And looking at it now, it seems I missed adding Thomas Zimmermann to Cc.

iosys_map?

should this be a follow up to the driver work or a prerequisite?
