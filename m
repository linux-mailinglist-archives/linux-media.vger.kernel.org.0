Hey Yury and Andy,

thanks for you review and discussion, after some further communication
with Nicolas Dufresne and Andrzej Pietrasiewicz, we came to the
conclusion that I will prepare a more general bit-writer API, which fits
better to the use-case we have on a lot of multimedia hardware.

I'll probably reuse the bitmap API as the backbone of that
implementation and use the `*_set8` to write the content back to memory,
but as we have a few more potential users for such an API, I'll strive
towards creating a new kernel API instead of extending an existing API
that isn't designed for our use-case.

Thanks a lot for your input and ideas.

Greetings,
Sebastian
