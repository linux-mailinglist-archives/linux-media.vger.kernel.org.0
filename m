Hi folks,

On Tue 11 Jul 23, 19:12, Paul Kocialkowski wrote:

So I wanted to shared an update on my side since I've been making progress =
on
the H.264 encoding work for Allwinner platforms. At this point the code sup=
ports
IDR, I and P frames, with a single reference. It also supports GOP (both cl=
osed
and open with IDR or I frame interval and explicit keyframe request) but us=
es
QP controls and does not yet provide rate control. I hope to be able to
implement rate-control before we can make a first public release of the cod=
e.

One of the main topics of concern now is how reference frames should be man=
aged
and how it should interact with kernel-side GOP management and rate control.

Leaving GOP management to the kernel-side implies having it decide which fr=
ame
should be IDR, I or P (and B for encoders that can support it), while keepi=
ng
the possibility to request a keyframe (IDR) and configure GOP size. Now it =
seems
to me that this is already a good balance between giving userspace a decent
level of control while not having to specify the frame type explicitly for =
each
frame or maintain a GOP in userspace.

Requesting the frame type explicitly seems more fragile as many situations =
will
be invalid (e.g. requesting a P frame at the beginning of the stream, etc) =
and
it generally requires userspace to know a lot about what the codec assumpti=
ons
are. Also for B frames the decision would need to be consistent with the fa=
ct
that a following frame (in display order) would need to be submitted earlier
than the current frame and inform the kernel so that the picture order count
(display order indication) can be maintained. This is not impossible or out=
 of
reach, but it brings a lot of complexity for little advantage.

Leaving the decision to the kernel side with some hints (whether to force a
keyframe, whether to allow B frames) seems a lot easier, especially for B f=
rames
since the kernel could just receive frames in-order and decide to hold one
so that it can use the next frame submitted as a forward reference for this
upcoming B frame. This requires flushing support but it's already well in p=
lace
for stateful encoders.

The next topic of interest is reference management. It seems pretty clear t=
hat
the decision of whether a frame should be a reference or not always needs t=
o be
taken when encoding that frame. In H.264 the nal_ref_idc slice header eleme=
nt
indicates whether a frame is marked as reference or not. IDR frames can
additionally be marked as long-term reference (if I understood correctly, t=
he
frame will stay in the reference picture list until the next IDR frame).
Frames that are marked as reference are added to the l0/l1 lists implicitly
that way and are evicted mostly depending on the number of reference slots
available, or when a new GOP is started.

With the frame type decided by the kernel, it becomes nearly impossible for
userspace to keep track of the reference lists. Userspace would at least ne=
ed
to know when an IDR frame is produced to flush the reference lists. In addi=
tion
it looks like most hardware doesn't have a way to explicitly discard previo=
us
frames that were marked as reference from being used as reference for next
frames. All in all this means that we should expect little control over the
reference frames list.

As a result my updated proposal would be to have userspace only indicate wh=
ether
a submitted frame should be marked as a reference or not instead of submitt=
ing
an explicit list of previous buffers that should be used as reference, which
would be impossible to honor in many cases.

Addition information gathered:
- It seems likely that the Allwinner Video Engine only supports one referen=
ce
  frame. There's a register for specifying the rec buffer of a second one b=
ut
  I have never seen the proprietary blob use it. It might be as easy as
  specifying a non-zero address there but it might also be ignored or requi=
re
  some undocumented bit to use more than one reference. I haven't made any
  attempt at using it yet.
- Contrary to what I said after Andrzej's talk at EOSS, most Allwinner plat=
forms
  do not support VP8 encode (despite Allwinner's proprietary blob having an
  API for it). The only platform that advertises it is the A80 and this mig=
ht
  actually be a VP8-only Hantro H1. It seems that the API they developed in=
 the
  library stuck around even if no other platform can use it.

Sorry for the long email again, I'm trying to be a bit more explanatory than
just giving some bare conclusions that I drew on my own.

What do you think about these ideas?

Cheers,

Paul
