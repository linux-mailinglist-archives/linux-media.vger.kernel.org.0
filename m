Low and behold, as I suspectd, my old VFS fsfreeze / thaw patch series
this. However I should note that I needed to add remove also the
WQ_FREEZABLE from fs as well, which was missing in my patch series, and
which Jan Kara had pointed out.

However, the VFS freeze work is quite a bit of work which we are still
discussing, so in the meantime, I think we have no other option but
to put the stop-gap patch I suggested with the usermode helper lock.
I will just modify it a bit more.

I'll also post my fs freeze work now again, but I'll note that it
still requires some more work to address everything which we have
discussed in the community. I'll post the patches as I think others
may be interested in the progress of that.
