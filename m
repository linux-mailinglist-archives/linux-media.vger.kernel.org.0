I'm pretty sure that this used to work in the past.

Can't we have something similar to[1]:

	include/config/auto.conf: .config

in order to force auto.conf to be re-generated if the .config file
was modified?

[1] yeah, I know that the above won't work currently, because of the
ifdefs, but perhaps something like this could be done inside the
"if KBUILD_EXTMOD" part of the Makefile.

Yeah, I noticed this new target on more recent Kernels. I was not
familiar with this "new" concept of "external"[2].

Maybe the text should be changed to something like:

   modules_prepare - Should be called before using "make M=<module dir>"

To make it clearer. Yet, having to call it *every time* a
Kconfig option has changed, doesn't seem right. The
building system could be smarter and re-build auto.conf if
it is older than .config file, or, at least, emit a WARNING, if
the file is not synchronized.


[2] Not sure if this still works, but, in the past (2.x), it was 
possible to setup an out-of-tree external tree with just a new 
driver. Then use "make modules" to build those external OOT 
modules. For historical reasons, still have at linuxtv.org 
one such tree:
