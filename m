The TRM on page 369 mentions that:

I understand that as them not sharing any memory and being able to work
independently.

I will send a new series shortly which enables only one of these four
cores, the functionality should be the same, it will just expose only
one video node which can get a four times throughput upgrade later once
we implement multi-core support in the driver.

Ah, that’s different then, I only had a cursory look at them back when I
implemented the JPEG decoder for sunxi.
