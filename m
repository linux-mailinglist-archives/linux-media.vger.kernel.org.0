Do note that USB webcams in Alder Lake laptops still work as usual, with
the uvcvideo driver.

V4L2 + MC are not great APIs for supporting hardware such as IPU6 and
coming up with an alternative is a major and risky endeavour. I expect many
developers of drivers for similar hardware are in the same situation.

The hardware is getting increasingly complex and while there is some
standardisation in the industry, it's mainly focussed on interoperatibility
on hardware level rather than control interfaces or defining how a given
feature is to be implemented.

As the camera is no longer a single, integrated device in this context but
multiple devices from different vendors, there still remains a larger
requirement for interoperability between, at the very least, cameras and
CSI-2 receivers --- that in turn increasingly often are integrated in Image
Signal Processors such as IPU6. This further raises the bar for an
interface that would better support these devices.

This of course does not help the owners of such hardware but perhaps
explains the current state of affairs a little. Eventually we will need a
new kernel interface for this but at this point I can't tell whether it
will be based on KCAM Sergey mentioned, or not.
