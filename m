I applied a variation of the patch in question, and I was able to both
successfully use g-streamer-1.0 and I was able to see UYVY appear in
the list.  in fact, G-Streamer-1.0 was faster than FFPEG with less
lag.

ioctl: VIDIOC_ENUM_FMT
        Type: Video Capture

        [0]: 'UYVY' (UYVY 4:2:2)
        [1]: 'RGB3' (RGB3, emulated)
        [2]: 'BGR3' (BGR3, emulated)
        [3]: 'YU12' (YU12, emulated)
        [4]: 'YV12' (YV12, emulated)

I don't know enough about VL2.  It looks like all the V4L stuff is in
the common isp files and not unique to the preview output, resizer
output or the CCDC output.  I don't have a CSI camera, so I cannot
test anything.

I checked all the video outputs, and they are all showing the same
information.  I realize the patch I found won't be accepted upstream
as-is, but it would be nice to have some mechanism in place that can
determine which output node is being used and somehow return the
correct data for each node.

I would like to do something to help improve this driver and/or make
it more compatible with some of the V4L tools (like G-Streamer), so if
someone has a recommendation on how we could move forward, I'm willing
work on it.
