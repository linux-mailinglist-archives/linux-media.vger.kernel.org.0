I meant the media device allocator api. I did some looking after I sent
this email. link_notify itself isn't in the media device allocator api
scope. What is missing is someway to provide registering link_notify
similar to entity_notify that exists today.

Perhaps we can adrres the link_notify can be solved in the future. Let's
chat when we meet in person at one of the conferences.
