As far as I could see we generally manage to include support for different
hardware setups in the same binding document using conditionals on the
compatible, so this feels a bit far-fetched.

Of course you're the maintainer and have significantly more experience here
so there might be a lot that I'm not seeing, but I'm not very convinced by =
this
reasoning to be honest.

Yeah and we very often end up with naming that is less than optimal (to stay
polite). I'm generally quite appalled by the overall lack of interest that
naming gets, as if it was something secondary. Naming is one of the most
important and difficult things in our field of work and it needs to be
considered with care.

This is not just a problem with device-tree, it's a kernel-wide issue that
nobody seems to be interested in addressing. I'm quite unhappy to see that =
when
time is spent trying to improve the situation on one particular instance, w=
e are
shown the door because it doesn't match what is generally done (and often d=
one
wrong).

This is definitely a rant. I really want to express this issue loud and cle=
ar
and encourage everyone to consider it for what it is.

Cheers,

Paul
