I think we were talking about whether the IOMMU should be considered 
mandatory for the future possible hardware.

About the right methods, I don't think we have a protocol for negotiate 
the allocation hints between drivers or anybody.
I sent an email to dri-devel to start(continue) the discussion of that.

I think the reserved memory exits even before the ION was in kernel.
Why Android prefer to use ION and now DMA-heap, I thinik it is a 
google's problem.
Youl can say what reserved memory didn't do is allowing allocate from 
the userspace. That is how gralloc in Android works.
Allocation decided by the users could be a important feature, for 
example, a video codec could decode either secure or non secure buffer.
We could make the driver only allocate the non secure memory while the 
usersapce could feed the secure memory, that could satisfy both generic 
application and DRM video playback.
