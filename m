If you think it actually fixes something, and does not cause a leak,
yes, please re-author it and feel free to take it.

But be aware that other submissions in this "set" are incorrect, and the
process we were working on with umn.edu was totally ignored, so feel
free to just drop it if you don't want to worry about it.  Failures of
kcalloc are pretty much impossible to hit as we all know.
