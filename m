I am trying to understand what 'plugin' here means? Is it a wrapper 
pertaining to use libcamera (fined tuned for atomisp) that apps can use?

A valid and solid use case yes!

In the longer term plan, I see this happening. I see there SPA support 
for libcamera in pipewire (not sure how much usable it is as of today). 
Once pipewire has a translating layer of ' request-controls' that can be 
mapped to libcamera controls, it would then make good base for 
applications for capturing video feeds by sending in requests with 
appropriate controls.

On the flatpak side, I think there will be more? plumbing work sinceÂ  
you need to use flatpak-portals, rather than just bundling the library 
in the manifest (the sandbox cannot determine system's h/w capabilites). 
The current org.freedesktop.portal.Camera [1] seems to be geared to use 
pipewire so that's a starting point. CV applications are yet another 
use-case libcamera will be interested in, I think. Getting the 
flatpak-portal support there might get tricky as of 'quirky' requests? 
for the camera and pipewire API seems to be limiting to support that 
use-case? Not sure how would this work out (and also a distant future),
