I definitely want to have some proposal that is (even vaguely) agreed upon
before proposing patches for mainline, even at the stage of RFC.

While I already have working results at this point, the API that is used is
very basic and just reuses controls from stateful encoders, with no extra
addition. Various assumptions are made in the kernel and there is no real
reference management, since the previous frame is always expected to be used
as the only reference.

We plan to make a public release at some point in the near future which sho=
ws
these working results, but it will not be a base for our discussion here ye=
t.

I don't have strong opinions about this. The rationale for my proposal is t=
hat
kernel-side rate control will be quite difficult to operate without knowled=
ge
of the period at which intra/inter frames are produced. Maybe there are kno=
wn
methods to handle this, but I have the impression that most rate control
implementations use the GOP size as a parameter.

More generally I think an expectation behind rate control is to be able to
decide at which time a specific frame type is produced. This is not possibl=
e if
the decision is entirely up to userspace.

Okay I understand the lower level of control make it possible to get much b=
etter
results than opaque firmware-driven encoders and it would be a shame to not
leverage this possibility with an API that is too restrictive.

However I do think it should be possible to operate the encoder without a l=
ot
of codec-specific supporting code from userspace. This is also why I like h=
aving
kernel-side rate control (among other reasons).

This is also what I understand from repeated reading of the spec and thanks=
 for
the summary write-up!

My assumption was that it would be preferable to operate in the simple fifo
mode since the memory management commands need to be added to the bitstream
headers and require coordination from the kernel. Like you said it seems co=
mplex
and error-prone.

But maybe this mechanism could be used to allow any particular reference fr=
ame
configuration, opening the way for userspace to fully decide what the refer=
ence
buffer lists are? Also it would be good to know if such mechanisms are gene=
rally
present in codecs or if most of them have an implicit reference list that c=
annot
be modified.

Having looked at both register layouts, I would tend to think both designs
are distinct. It's still unclear where Allwinner's video engine comes from:
perhaps they made it in-house, perhaps some obscure Chinese design house ma=
de it
for them or it could be known hardware with a modified register layout.

I would also be interested to know if the H1 can do more than one reference!

VA seems too low-level for our case here, as it seems to expect full control
over more or less each bitstream parameter that will be produced.

I think we have to find some middle-ground that is not as limiting as state=
ful
encoders but not as low-level as VA.

Hehe I wish I had some advanced proposal here but my implementation is quite
simplified compared to what we have to plan for mainline.
