Let's go with 1. There is not much point in backporting since destaging
the HEVC API will also change it, so userspace will need to adapt. It's
a staging driver anyway (although hopefully not for long).

If you post a v2 on top of the latest series from Benjamin, then that
should almost certainly work fine when Benjamin posts what will hopefully
be the final version of his series. When it is all OK, then I put both in
the same PR.
