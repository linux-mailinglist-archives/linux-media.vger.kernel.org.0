s/you guys/you/ if you have to blame anyone - I'm the only s-o-b in
these patches. I'm sending these to _build consensus_ on what may be a good
use for it showing a real problem it's helping to fix.

 From its documentation:

  * The type :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>` and its helpers are
  * actually independent from the dma-buf infrastructure. When sharing buffers
  * among devices, drivers have to know the location of the memory to access
  * the buffers in a safe way. :c:type:`struct dma_buf_map <dma_buf_map>`
  * solves this problem for dma-buf and its users. If other drivers or
  * sub-systems require similar functionality, the type could be generalized
  * and moved to a more prominent header file.

if there is no consensus and a better alternative, I'm perfectly fine in
throwing it out and using the better approach.
