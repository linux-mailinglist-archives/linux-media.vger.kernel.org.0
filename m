I seem to have such a system where one device can snoop the CPU cache
and the other cannot. Therefore if I want to support it properly, I do
need cache flush/sync. I don't actually try to access the data using
the CPU (and when I do, I call the sync start/end ioctls).

That only works if the importers call the begin_cpu_access() /
end_cpu_access(), which they don't.

But again that would only work if the importers would call
begin_cpu_access() / end_cpu_access(), which they don't, because they
don't actually access the data using the CPU.

Unless you mean that the exporter can call sync_for_cpu/sync_for_device
before/after every single DMA transfer so that the data appears
coherent to the importers, without them having to call
begin_cpu_access() / end_cpu_access().

In which case - this would still demultiply the complexity; my USB-
functionfs interface here (and IIO interface in the separate patchset)
are not device-specific, so I'd rather keep them importers.

[snip]

Agreed. Desiging a good generic solution would be better.

With that said...

Let's keep it out of this USB-functionfs interface for now. The
interface does work perfectly fine on platforms that don't have
coherency problems. The coherency issue in itself really is a
tangential issue.

So I will send a v6 where I don't try to force the cache coherency -
and instead assume that the attached devices are coherent between
themselves.

But it would be even better to have a way to detect non-coherency and
return an error on attach.

Cheers,
