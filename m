You'll need the mmap_sem to get at the vma to be able to do this
check. If you add that to _fast, you made it as fast as the slow one.
Plus there's _fast_only due to locking recurion issues in fast-paths
(I assume, I didn't check all the callers).

I'm just wondering whether we have a bug somewhere with device
drivers. For CMA regions we always check in try_grab_page, but for dax
I'm not seeing where the checks in the _fast fastpaths are, and that
all still leaves random device driver mappings behind which aren't
backed by CMA but still point to something with a struct page behind
it. I'm probably just missing something, but no idea what.
