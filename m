Yes, the global digital gain overwrites the per-channel ones

Nope, that's a no-op

0x3028, albeit documented differently, effectively changes the global
analog gain as the lower 6 bits of 0x305e do.

Values set to 0x3028 are reflected in 0x305e and viceversa, so I think
that V4L2_CID_ANALOG_GAIN can be safely directed to 0x3028 without
the need to read back the current digital gain value before reading the
register.

The per-channel analog gains component will be overwritten
but considering that the existing CID_GAIN, CID_BLUE_BALANCE and
CID_RED_BALANCE cluster computes the green/red/blue analog and digital
gains as follows:

	int green = sensor->ctrls.gain->val;
	int red = max(green + sensor->ctrls.red_balance->val, 0);
	int blue = max(green + sensor->ctrls.blue_balance->val, 0);
	unsigned int gain = min(red, min(green, blue));
	unsigned int analog = min(gain, 64u); /* range is 0 - 127 */

So that CID_GAIN is mapped on the green channel, the only way to make
this less nasty would be to actually define multi-dimensional
DIGITAL and ANALOG gain controls, where the three channels are mapped
to the three dimensions, and use CID_DIGITAL_GAIN and CID_ANALOG_GAIN
as global control gains (with the caveat that the global gains are
meant to override the per channel ones).

Personally I'm fine with a single, non-clusterized CID_ANALOG_GAIN and
leave the existing cluster as it is. The multi-dimensional control
might indeed prove useful albeit it will break existing applications
that rely on the CID_GAIN/RED,BLUE_BALANCE cluster.

There is nothing interesting there if not default values. I was hoping
that analogue_gain_m0 analogue_gain_c0 and analogue_gain_m1
analogue_gain_c1 would provide a way to inject gains using the
standard CCS gain model, but those registers are said to be read-only
and do not change when the global analog gain changes, so I wonder if
the SMIA/CCS interface for this chip is actually enabled (it might
depend on the fw revision ?)
