That's your use case, but there could be use cases which work
differently. In fact, in ChromeOS we only use the secure allocation
path for protected content, because it imposes some overhead.

For such limitations, there is the shared DMA pool or restricted DMA
pool functionality, which can be given to a device in DT and then the
DMA mapping API would just allocate within that area for that device.
Maybe that's what you need here?

So the heap is only for the video device?

Do we need the kernel to tell the userspace which heap to use? As you
mentioned above, the heap would be specific for the video device and
the userspace would also be specific for your use case, so why
couldn't it just find the right heap on its own (e.g. by name)?

As for heap flags, could you elaborate on what kind of flags you
imagine could be decided by a V4L2 driver?

Tomasz
