The fallback would likely be a CPU copy with the appropriate cache
flushes done by the device driver, which would be a massiv performance
issue.

I don't think the V4L2 part works for most ARM systems. The default
there is for devices to be noncoherent unless explicitly marked
otherwise. I don't think any of the "devices" writing the video buffers
in cached memory with the CPU do this. While we could probably mark
them as coherent, I don't think this is moving in the right direction.

I would like to see this solved properly. Where I think properly means
we make things work on systems with mixed coherent/noncoherent masters
in the same way the DMA API does on such systems: by inserting the
proper cache maintenance operations.

I also think that we should keep in mind that the world is moving into
a direction where DMA masters may not only snoop the CPU caches (what
is the definition of cache coherent on x86), but actually take part in
the system coherence and are able to have writeback caches for shared
data on their own. I can only speculate, as I haven't seen the amdgpu
side yet, but I think this proposal is moving in the other direction by
assuming a central system cache, where the importer has some magic way
to clean this central cache.

Since I have a vested interest in seeing V4L2 UVC and non-coherent GPU
dma-buf sharing work on ARM systems and seem to hold some strong
opinions on how this should work, I guess I need to make some time
available to type it up, so we can discuss over coder rather than
abstract ideas. If I come up with something that works for my use-cases
would you be up for taking a shot at a amdgpu implementation?

Regards,
Lucas
