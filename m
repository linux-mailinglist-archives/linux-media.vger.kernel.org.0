Well, I see that patch went in v5.9-rc1, so it will be part of v5.9.

If the bindings update goes in in v5.10 (or whatever comes after v5.9)
then we have a problem, as the DTB created for v5.9 won't work anymore
on any later version, and that should not happen. Alternatively, a fix
for the next -rc release could be fast-tracked, but you would
need to synchronize with the dt maintainers for that and make a patch
for the existing .txt bindings file.

If the name change happens in the yaml file and one release is made
with the old names, then we're stuck with those forever and ever, if I
got the situation right.

Please check with the dt and media maintainers, or they can comment
here if they glance through these lines.

Thanks
