Actually no, the function __media_pipeline_start gives the same pipe to all entities that are reachable
with an enabled link from the entity that called 'media_pipeline_start' (the direction of the link does not matter in that case).
So that means that all entities that are connected have the same pipe.

The term 'stream' is a path from the capture down to the sensor, so we can have two streams sharing the same pipe.
