Well pwm_apply_state() is the atomic PWM interface right?

So to me pwm_apply_state_atomic() would be clearly about
running atomically.

I would just go with:

pwm_apply_state_atomic()

but if this is disliked by others then lets just rename

pwm_apply_state() to pwm_apply_state_cansleep() as
is done in this patch and use plain pwm_apply_state()
for the new atomic-context version.

Hans
