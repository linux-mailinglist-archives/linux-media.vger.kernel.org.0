Ok, now it is making more sense. Please update the comments for
patch 10/17 to describe the above.

We need some time to test this though, in order to check if no
regressions were added (except the ones due to changeset 50ac952d2263).

If I recall correctly, we didn't have any DMABUF support
at the media subsystem, back on 2013.

It took some time for the DMA-BUF to arrive at media, as this
was not a top priority. Also, there aren't many developers that
understand the memory model well enough to implement DMA-BUF support
and touch the VB2 code, which is quite complex, as it supports
lots of different ways for I/O, plus works with vmalloc, DMA
contig and DMA scatter/gather. 

Changes there should carefully be tested against different
drivers, in order to avoid regressions on it.
