That's right, but semantics of the try operation for formats and
controls are inherently different, so it's impossible to get it
completely right in any case. To really solve this, we need to move
control storage to the v4l2_subdev_state structure, and extend the
subdev control ioctls with a which field. That's out of scope for this
series.

I'm fine with this approach as a temporary hack.
