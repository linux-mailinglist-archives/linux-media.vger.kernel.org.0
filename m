After a closer look I tend to agree with you: they moved some registers aro=

but it still seems to be the same base unit.

Yeah I think it would make sense to keep the SoC-specific terminology in the
compatible, so I agree that "rockchip,px30-vip" and "rockchip,rk3568-vicap"
feel like the most relevant choices here.

Nice! I guess there will be a need to introduce a variant structure associa=
ted
to each compatible to express the differences betweens these different
generations.

Note that we will also probably need to convert the driver over to a MC-cen=
tric
approach, but this is of course outside of the scope of this series.
