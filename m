As for the patch itself, it is RFC i.e., not request for immediate
merge. I sent v2 quickly primarily to address the motivation part
properly. I'll phase this down a bit, and rework on issues in the uAPI I
observed (and remarked in a response to this patch) etc., and generally
give people some time to digest.
