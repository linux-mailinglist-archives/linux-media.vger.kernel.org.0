Yeah, that is certainly a very valid concern.

Sure they are! Just take a look at an attachment:

struct dma_buf_attachment {
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  struct dma_buf *dmabuf;
 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  struct device *dev;

This is the struct device which is importing the buffer and the patch in 
discussion is just printing the name of this device into sysfs.

Correct, since we don't really need a device as an exporter (it can just 
be a system heap as well) we only have a const char* as name for the 
exporter.

See this chunk here:

+
+Â Â Â  list_for_each_entry(attachment, &dmabuf->attachments, node) {
+Â Â Â  Â Â Â  if (attachment->map_counter) {
+Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  ret += sysfs_emit_at(buf, ret, "%s ",
+Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â  dev_name(attachment->dev));
+Â Â Â  Â Â Â  }
+Â Â Â  }

And yes now that Daniel mentioned that it looks like a sysfs rules 
violation to me as well.

Regards,
Christian.
