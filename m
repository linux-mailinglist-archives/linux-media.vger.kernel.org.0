Good catch, I wonder if that is what causes failure to stream here
https://lore.kernel.org/all/3b54ab9b-4ffd-ab32-d495-fad6132ea504@microchip.com/

Will fix in v2.

It's the second phrase "though on-chip reset is included" that makes me 
believe they require it to be HW only.

Makes sense, I will try this out and spin it as a separate series.

Thanks, my module is similar with MIPI but only has the PWUP gpio line. 
Might send you the patches separately if it doesn't work on my setup.
