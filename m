It's also a matter of consistency, to try and unify the coding style
across similar drivers in a subsytem. In this case, the media system
frowns upon C++-style comments.

I find the second option much more readable, yes.

Code is written once and read often, so you should consider the coding
style in use in the subsystem.

Additional controls may be needed, I haven't studied this particular
sensor in details, but in general frame rate is controlled explicitly
through low-level parameters for raw sensors, which means controlling
h/v blank and possibly the pixel clock from userspace. The
.g_frame_interval() and .s_frame_interval() operations are deprecated
(and should never have been used) for raw sensors.
