Not clear at all, this is not how kernel development works.

Developers submit changes they are comfortable with and wish to get
merged, and reviewers review them and merge them if all is good.

Do not submit stuff that you do not feel comfortable with having merged
as that just wastes reviewer's time.

Are you helping to review code that developers submit but say they do
not want to have merged?

best of luck!
