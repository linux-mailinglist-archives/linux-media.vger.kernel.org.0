So the encrypted compressed stream (contained in a regular non-secure buffer)
is decrypted here into secure buffers. Correct?

The hardware codec will just operate on those secure buffers, both for the
output and capture queues, right? And no decryption/encryption takes place,
it is all operating on unencrypted secure buffers, right?

Or is the plan to include the decryption step in the driver?

But who encrypted the compressed stream? Is it encrypted according to
some standard? Or it is mediatek specific?
