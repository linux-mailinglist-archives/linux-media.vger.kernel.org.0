Greg, on a side note, the discussion originated from
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/m3r1gt5hzm.fsf@t19.piap.pl/. I'll
quote Krzysztof so the discussion doesn't get split across multiple
places:

Your opinion on this would be valuable too.

Quoting Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst:

Sign your work - the Developer's Certificate of Origin
------------------------------------------------------

To improve tracking of who did what, especially with patches that can
percolate to their final resting place in the kernel through several
layers of maintainers, we've introduced a "sign-off" procedure on
patches that are being emailed around.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below:

Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line saying::

        Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>


The SoB line doesn't convey any license information, that's specified
separately and explicitly in each file (usually in the form of an SPDX
tag, which is just a machine-parsable, short-hand version of a full
license header in text form).
