I'm not sure if the word 'mmap' is proper here.

It is kind of like the mapping from (FD+offset) to backend memory,
which is directly provided by memory provider, rather than via VMA
and cpu page table.  Basically VMA & cpu page table are for host to
access the memory, but VMM/host doesn't access most of the guest
memory, so why must build them.

Exactly.

Yes. With this new sharing model, the lifecycle of the shared memory/pfn/Page
is directly controlled by dma-buf exporter, not by CPU mapping. So I also
think reservation lock & move_notify works well for lifecycle control,
no conflict (nothing to do) with follow_pfn() & mmu_notifier.

Maybe we need to specify which object the API is operating on,
struct dma_buf, or struct dma_buf_attachment, or a new attachment.

I think:

  int (*dmabuf_get_memory)(struct dma_buf_attachment *attach, struct memory_chunks **chunks, size_t *num_chunks);

works, but maybe a new attachment is conceptually more clear to
importers and harder to abuse?
