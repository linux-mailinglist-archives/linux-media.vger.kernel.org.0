Hi Hans,

Thank you for the patch.

We've worked hard to avoid adding ACPI-specific code such as this in
sensor drivers, as it would then spread like crazy, and also open the
door to more ACPI-specific support. I don't want to open this pandora's
box, I'd like to see this handled in another layer (the I2C core could
be a condidate for instance, but bonus points if it can be handled in
the ACPI subsystem itself).
