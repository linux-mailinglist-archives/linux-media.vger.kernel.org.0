Hey,

Long time, good to see you are still around and interested in these topics =

I think I would need a bit more context to understand this case, especially
what the hardware could decide to discard.

My understanding is that the VP8 encoder needs to write part of the header
separately from the coded data and uses distinct address registers for the =
two.
So the approach is to move the hw-generated headers and coded data before
returning to userspace.

I am strongly against this approach, instead I think we need to keep all
vendor-specific parts in the kernel driver and provide a clean unified user=
space
API.

Also I think V4L2 has way to set multiple controls at once, so the
userspace/kernel context switching is rather minimal and within reasonable
expectations. Of course it will never be as efficient as userspace mapping =
the
hardware registers in virtual memory but there are so many problems with th=
is
approach that it's really not worth it.

Following my previous point, I am also strongly against exposing the
reconstruction buffer to userspace.

Returning the encoded bitstream size is perfectly generic and available to
every encoder. Maybe we could also return some average QP value since that
seems quite common. Other than that the rest should be kept in-kernel so we
can have a generic API.

Also it seems that the Hantro H1 specific mechanism (checkpoint-based) is n=
ot
necessarily a lot better than regular QP-wide settings.
