Well, if Windows doesn't use this information, it is almost guaranteed
to be garbage.

So maybe it would be better to make acpi_graph_ignore_port() return
true by default and false only when the information is known to be
valid.  IOW, whitelist things instead of adding blacklist entries in
perpetuum.

And hopefully we'll eventually get to the point at which we are able
to say "whitelist everything from now on".
