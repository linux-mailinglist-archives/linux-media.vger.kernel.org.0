I would agree, but with a caveat: how do we want to deal with malicious
applications here? The application should have expressed that it's okay
for it to be charged by a different process, otherwise it becomes
trivial for a malicious app to create arbitrary charges against another
application in the system and DoS it.

But then, that means that an application could arbitrarily charge the
daemon as well if it doesn't opt-in but asks for allocations.

So maybe we should have an opt-in for the caller, and a way for the
daemon to check if the caller has indeed opted in before performing the
allocation (and the charge transfer)?

I don't think that's true anymore. heaps are used in lots of different
use cases now in the embedded space, including in regular, generic,
components not specifically used for embedded systems.
