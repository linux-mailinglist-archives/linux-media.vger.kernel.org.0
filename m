I'm used to declaring variables in the order of first use,
but I don't really mind it either way. I'll move it down.

I must admit that I didn't give it too much thought. I just
did it similar to the other delay used in this driver
(AK7375_CTRL_DELAY_US). As for adding 2ms, I don't know what
the worst case wake-up time is since I don't have a datasheet
on hand, so I just wanted to stay safe. Also, this driver
doesn't really recover if it fails to resume (which is what
used to happen before adding a delay). Rounding up to 5ms
felt good enough.

Seems good. I haven't yet had it fail to power on within 3ms of
turning on regulators so I guess there is no reason to worry about it.
