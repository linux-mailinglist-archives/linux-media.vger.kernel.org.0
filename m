The reason why I'd like to see libcamera support for the ISP driver is
to ensure that the kernel API is adequate for real use cases. The API
can be split in three parts:

- Pipeline configuration (this includes the media controller topology,
  link setting, subdev pad format/selection rectangle configuration,
  ...)
- ISP parameters
- ISP statistics

A pipeline handler implementation will cover the first parts. The second
and third parts need to be tested too, but we don't need to implement
every single feature. A very simple algorithm that demonstrates
statistics can be captured and ISP parameters can be set should be
enough to test and exercise the API in real scenarios. We're working on
making basic AE and AWB algorithm implementations generic (or at least
creating generic building blocks that can easily be assembled to create
those algorithms, as the ISP statistics and parameters are specific to
the ISP and thus require some ISP-specific code), so that should become
a fairly easy task soon. I expect most of the work to go in the pipeline
handler.

Does this sound fair to you ?
