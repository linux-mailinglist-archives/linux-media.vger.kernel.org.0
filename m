SVP =3D Secure Video Path, which is explained in what you linked to below.

The TEE does the decryption of the incoming stream to the secure
buffer...and that is then fed into the output queue of v4l2. So
there's no handling of encrypted content in the kernel patches...it's
just about handling secure buffers and secure surfaces.

Yeah, the driver does need to know if the FDs are from secure or
non-secure memory...which is what the SVP control was about.

That fd is allocated from the secure dma-buf heap which is being
proposed in another patchset.

Ahh ok, good point about the control being able to be toggled at any
time. So adding a new V4L2_MEMORY_ type would make sense relating to
that.
