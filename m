If you add a whitelist for systems where the port aren't just dropped, that
is bound to break camera on a lot of current systems that depend on the
said port nodes.

I don't disagree with that as such but it's not really the matter here, is
it?

Historically, some systems were amended with special "Linux support" which
I believe is what these Dell systems have. That was done because the IPU
bridge driver did not exist yet. I frankly don't think it was ever tested
on Linux either.
