Yes, they are totally independent video decoder peripherals, handling
different codecs. While I'm not aware that there is a SKU that only
uses one of them, there is a provision in the fuses to disable either
one of the VPU peripherals, so they clearly can work independently.

Smashing them together in one DT node was a mistake IMO. Both VPUs do
not share more than a common power-domain and use the same AMBA domain
bridge to hook into to SoC NoC. On the i.MX8M Mini we have a similar
VPU subsystem, but with nested power domains, so G1, G2 and the new H1
encoder on this chip can even be powered-gated individually.

I agree that the commit message should point out that new DT + old
kernel is not a supported configuration. It isn't optimal, but IMHO a
small price to pay for the ability to handle all the i.MX8M* family VPU
subsystems in the same way with a proper blk-ctrl driver for the common
clock and reset block and the VPUs being independent peripherals.

I'm in favor of dropping the old binding from the schema. New DTs
should clearly use the new binding and old DTs shouldn't change
anymore, so validation is less useful there.
