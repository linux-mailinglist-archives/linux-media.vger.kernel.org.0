Definitely.

Ah, I missed that explanation. Yes, it looks like both need to be considered.

There are not all that many users of sg_alloc_table_from_pages(_segment),
dma_get_max_seg_size and dma_max_mapping_size, so it doesn't look too difficult
for a sufficiently motivated person (not me!) to make changes here.
