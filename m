Sorry my bad, currently we don't have usecase where multiple devices 
sharing the same PM domain that have HW control support, so there is no 
synchronization issue.

But it would be good to have .get_hwmode_dev() callback for consumer 
drivers to query the actual GenPD mode from HW, whenever they require it.
