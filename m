That makes sense, and that suggests also that the firmware does more-or-less
the right thing. Good to know.

I disagree with that last paragraph. Which fields to set depends on what
the pixelformat supports. In the case of this driver that only sets the
V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE flag, you only set that field, the others
will be set for you. And it also really depends on what the application
wants: it might want to select a specific YCbCr encoding, but not care
that much about the quantization, so it would set the ycbcr_enc field,
but keep the other at 0.

Personally I would just drop that last paragraph.

Because YCbCr is almost always limited range. The only exception is if
it will feed into a JPEG encoder since that one wants full range.

So V4L2_MAP_QUANTIZATION_DEFAULT will select limited range.

At some point someone will have to decide somewhere what colorimetry to
assign to the picture. Whether that is the driver or userspace is dependent
on how the pipeline works.

It's easy for e.g. video receivers since the received video will typically
use well defined colorimetry values (usually transmitted through metadata).
And Codecs will encode that information in the compressed stream, so there
is it also available.

The purpose of an ISP is really to take raw images and covert them to something
that looks good when interpreted using specific colorimetry values. What those
are and who sets them is dependent on the ISP.

Right now COLORSPACE_RAW kind of implies (undocumented) the xfer_func
is undetermined, and XFER_FUNC_NONE is used in that case. But I think it
is a bit misleading. V4L2_XFER_FUNC_NONE is used in a few sensor drivers,
probably with the meaning of 'undetermined' and not 'linear'.

It's hard to do right. It is often ignored, since in many cases there isn't a
whole lot that you can do about it to correct it, and the differences between
the various colorspace/xfer_func/ycbcr_enc values is hard to see for most
people, unless you see it side-by-side. Exception is the quantization range,
if that's wrong then it is very visible.

In the future this is going to be more important when HDR and Bt.2020 becomes
more common: those look very different from e.g. Rec.709.

As I understand it, selecting the SRGB colorspace preset in the firmware
will produce exactly this. The firmware doesn't allow you to specify the
other three fields, they are hardcoded depending on the preset. So telling
userspace that they can 'set' these fields is not right. They can only
select the colorspace and the driver will fill in the other fields with
'suitable values', in this case depending on the preset, which in turn
is selected with the colorspace.

I'm not sure I understand. If you leave it up to the driver, then the
driver has to set correct values. Depending on what it does that will
indeed be from what was specified on the output, or using the
V4L2_MAP_YCBCR_ENC_DEFAULT etc. macros, or retrieving it from a
compressed stream (if it is a decoder). It still has to state what it
produces based on whatever information it has.

Yes, exactly. That will work here.

So what does the preset do exactly? It is now starting to sound like
it actually selects the xfer_func, ycbcr_enc and quantization, but not the
colorspace since that's defined by the CCM set by userspace.

It would actually make more sense to me that way.

One thing that is missing in the documentation is a rule what to do if
userspace asks for a combination of fields that is not supported by the
driver. In that case there has to be a priority given to each of the four
fields. Luckily for colorimetry that is clear: colorspace has the highest
prio, then xfer_func, then ycbcr_enc and quantization is last.

The CSC flags tell you what you can override. You are at all times free
to just fill in what you want, but only those fields that the hardware
supports will be used.

The driver shouldn't lie about what it supports, i.e. if the quantization
range is hardcoded depending on the other colorimetry fields, then it
shouldn't say it can.

Based on how I now understand the ISP works the three presets map to:

XFER_FUNC_SRGB, YCBCR_ENC_601, FULL_RANGE
XFER_FUNC_REC709, YCBCR_ENC_601, LIM_RANGE
XFER_FUNC_REC709, YCBCR_ENC_709, LIM_RANGE

So to pick the correct preset it needs the XFER_FUNC and YCBCR_ENC
from userspace, but not the QUANTIZATION.

If userspace would select XFER_FUNC_SRGB/ENC_709, then it would prioritize
XFER_FUNC_SRGB and replace ENC_709 with ENC_601.

The colorspace depends on the CCM from userspace, so the driver can
just copy this field from the output to the capture side. It is up to
userspace to decide whether to leave it at RAW or fill in the actual
colorspace the CCM will produce.

Based on this the driver would set V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_XFER_FUNC and
V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_YCBCR_ENC. The application can fill in all four fields,
but only these two would be used to select the preset. The colorspace
would just be copied from output to capture, and the quantization would
be hardcoded based on the chosen preset.
