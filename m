OK then fence release should be able to point back to its "context"
structure. Either a "private" data in dma fence or we need to "embed"
fence into another object (refcounted) that owns the lock and provide
dma fence ops->release callback, which can container_of() to the object
that dma fence is embedded into.

I think you are suggesting the latter. Thanks for clarifications.

The limiting factor of this approach is that now our ops->release() is
under the same "pressure" as dma_fence_put()->dma_fence_release() are.
dma_fence_put() and dma_fence_release() can be called from any context,
as far as I understand, e.g. IRQ, however our normal object ->release
can schedule, we do things like synchronize_rcu() and so on. Nothing is
impossible, just saying that even this approach is not 100% perfect and
may need additional workarounds.

Hmm, indeed... I didn't consider fence_ops case.

OK. I see.
