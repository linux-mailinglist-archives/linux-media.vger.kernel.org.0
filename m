I wasn't CC'd on the other threads so I don't know.  :/  I have always
assumed it was something like this but I don't know the details and
there is no documentation.

You're essentially arguing that it's a #1 on Rusty's scale but ideally
we would want to be at #7.

With the current API we're constantly adding bugs.  I imagine that once
we add a straight forward default and some documentation then we will
solve this.

That's the approach that we've been trying and it's clearly not working.
