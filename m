Thanks for the feedback, in multimedia (unlike register programming), we do=
n't
really consider bitstreams as bitmap or bitfield. What we do really expect =
is to
use bit writer helpers (and sometimes a bit reader though we try and avoid =
the
second one in the  kernel). Its more of less a cursor (a bit position) into=
 a
memory that advance while writing. A bit writer should help protect against
overflow too.

When writing lets say a chain of 8 bits from a char, a proper helper is exp=
ected
to be very explicit on the ordering (write_u8_le/be or something better wor=
ded).
I would rather like to see all these blobs written this way personally then
having a cleared buffer and writing using bit offsets.

Perhaps I may suggest to start with implementing just that inside this driv=
er?
It isn't very hard, and then the implementation can be reduced later and sh=
ared
later, with whatever exists without deviating from the intent of the existi=
ng
API ? I do believe that having this in linux-media can be useful in the fut=
ure.
We will notably need to extend such a helper with multimedia specific codin=
g
technique (golomb, boolean coding, etc.) for use in stateless encoder drive=
rs.
