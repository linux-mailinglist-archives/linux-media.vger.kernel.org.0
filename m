Sebastian,

After a bunch of testing, I think the issue I was having was the BTS
file being pulled in from linux-firmware.  I was able to successfully
load a BTS file that I have from Logic PD with working BLE and BT
working together.  I have to run some tests, but if you wouldn't mind
re-basing your code and pushing it again for review, I can most likely
add my 'tested-by'
I am not sure who to discuss my perceived bug in the BTS blob.  I have
to go find the old BTS editor and see if I can determine the cause,
but the fact that I can use the BTS file that corresponds to the FCC
certified file that Logic PD used is more important to me than using
the generic BTS file provided by TI, however it would be nice for the
reference BTS file to operate without error.
