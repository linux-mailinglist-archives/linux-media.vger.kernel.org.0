Indeed, that's why I said two pixels -samples-.

Maybe the usage of 'sample' is not right ? Two pixel samples in YUYV
mode to me means two bytes which form 1 pixel.

Thanks, very clear. I didn't get the last part about the MQ. I thought
the NW csi-2 receiver worked with 8-bit samples that's why we need to
maintain the CSI bridge compatible with the 2X8 format variant (this
and also for imx7 + parallel).

Actually, looking at the MQ reference manual

"15.2.1.3.5 CSI-2 Controller Core Configurations"  reports:
The CSI-2 RX Controller Core User Interface supports either a single,
double, or quad pixel wide data path. The double and quad wide pixel
modes can help reduce the frequency the user interface must run at
while the single pixel wide mode can be easier to interface to for
some applications.

This chip supports the following:
â€¢ Single Pixel Configuration

It seems the csi-2 receiver on the MQ works in single pixel mode only.
It should then expose the 2X8 format variant only, which is
technically incorrect for a serial transmitter. Cul de sac ?
