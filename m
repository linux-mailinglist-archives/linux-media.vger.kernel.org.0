This is guest side thing, is it? Anything host need to opt-in?

VFIO could choose never to mmap MMIO, so in this case nothing to do?

Intel TDX Connect has a extra requirement for "unbind":

- Revoke KVM page table (S-EPT) for the MMIO only after TDISP
  CONFIG_UNLOCK

Another thing is, seems your term "bind" includes all steps for
shared -> private conversion. But in my mind, "bind" only includes
putting device in TDISP LOCK state & corresponding host setups required
by firmware. I.e "bind" means host lockes down the CC setup, waiting for
guest attestation.

While "unbind" means breaking CC setup, no matter the vPCI device is
already accepted as CC device, or only locked and waiting for attestation.

Yeah, I see the merit.

I'm not sure if Alexey's patch [1] illustates your idea. It calls
tsm_tdi_bind() which directly does device stuff, and impacts MMIO.
VFIO doesn't know about this.

I have to interpret this as VFIO firstly hand over device CC features
and MMIO resources to IOMMUFD, so VFIO never cares about them.

To keep from crashing, The kernel still needs to enforce some firmware
specific rules. That doesn't reduce the interactions between kernel
components. E.g. for TDX, if VFIO doesn't control "bind" but controls
MMIO, it should refuse FLR or MSE when device is bound. That means VFIO
should at least know from IOMMUFD whether device is bound.

Further more, these rules are platform firmware specific, "QEMU executes
kernel checks" means more SW components should be aware of these rules.
That multiples the effort.

And QEMU can be killed, means if kernel wants to reclaim all the
resources, it still have to deal with the sequencing. And I don't think
it is a good idea that kernel just stales large amount of resources.
