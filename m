So it is really similar to ignore_cap_streaming: that relaxes the streaming test,
and 'buffered' relaxes the 'must have at least one capture and output buffer ready'
test.

So this should be renamed to: allow_empty_queues

Although I would prefer to split this into two bools: allow_empty_capture_queue and
allow_empty_output_queue. It is more flexible that way and I actually think it is
easier to understand.

I see also see in the v4l2-mem2mem.c source that the debug messages are very poorly
worded:
	src = v4l2_m2m_next_src_buf(m2m_ctx);

        if (!src && !m2m_ctx->out_q_ctx.buffered) {
                dprintk("No input buffers available\n");
                goto job_unlock;
        }

This should be either "source buffers" or "output buffers", but definitely not
"input buffers".

Ditto for the dst part.

Could be. I hope to be able to spend a bit of time on this today.
