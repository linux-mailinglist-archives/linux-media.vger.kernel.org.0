Hi,

I don't understand how inability to build software is not an uapi 
breakage -- care to elaborate?

Be it umaintained or not, it's still in distributions (the above is from 
opensuse build system) and it is broken now. Every single distributor 
now would have to go and fix this.

So either you fix it (e.g. re-add only the entries as I suggested) or I 
will post a revert of your patch. Sorry, no excuses.

thanks,
