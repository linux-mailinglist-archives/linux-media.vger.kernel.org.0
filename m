Correct. And technically, that is also correct: a colorspace describes
just the primaries and whitepoint.

I assume that's a question for Dave, but that is what I would expect.
My gut feeling is that the enum just selects one of three predefined
3x3 matrices + vector. In which case it does not touch the transfer
function, let alone the colorspace.

But without knowing the details, I can't be certain of course.

Yes. Perhaps this would be better:

"then that colorimetry setting will be ignored and the driver will set it
to a suitable value."

Or something along those lines...

This example describes what happens without any overrides from userspace.
So either V4L2_PIX_FMT_FLAG_SET_CSC is cleared, or all four colorimetry
fields are set to DEFAULT.

And see above for a better description of what the spec should say.

Without SET_CSC. Sorry, I should have been clearer.

It all depends what the device actually does: if it takes the raw data,
then does color correction and produces a usable picture, then that
would imply that the final image conforms to one of the colorspaces
and transfer functions.

If it just converts from Bayer to NV12, then it would produce, as you
say, an unusable picture. Garbage in, garbage out.

I have considered adding an XFER_FUNC_RAW setting. As opposed to NONE,
which really just means a linear mapping. It might make sense to
introduce that, I would have no problem with it.

Either is fine. But historically you will see a lot of COLORSPACE_JPEG usage,
and that won't go away. So you'll have to support both in libcamera.

Right.

Exactly. The precise behavior of the driver will depend on what the
device actually does.

True, but in order to know how to display final picture the ISP delivers,
you need to know against what colorspace and transfer function have to be
used to interpret the result.

An ISP takes a raw image and processes it to deliver something that is
using well-defined colorimetry. If it is not well defined you basically
still have no idea how to interpret the colors.

No, this is a valid thing to do.

So if I understand it the device always produces YUV video, but in
three different modes: something that is suitable for a JPEG encoder
that expects full range sRGB, SDTV-style colorimetry and HDTV-style
colorimetry. In that case setting V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_COLORSPACE is
actually valid. If userspace doesn't override the colorspace, then
the default behavior will be used (SDTV or HDTV, depending on the
resolution), or it outputs according to the chosen colorspace and
the settings for the other three fields implied by the preset.

You wouldn't set the other V4L2_FMT_FLAG_CSC_ flags since you can't
influence them separately, they are fixed depending on the colorspace
(aka preset) itself.

Ah, I didn't know that. Then you really should not use COLORSPACE_JPEG,
that is something that should only be used for actual JPEG compressed
video. It's very weird to see it used for uncompressed video. Legal,
but weird.

I think there are still a bunch of old sensor drivers that incorrectly
report JPEG as well, even though they just transmit uncompressed video.
I never dared to change them, it's hard to predict what might break.

The former, yes.

I believe this is the first time an ISP needs this, so it's good to discuss
this!
