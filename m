Hi all,

Since countries are opening up again and travel is (at least for now!) a lot easier,
I am considering a media summit during the ELCE in Dublin (Sep 13-16).

See here for more details about the conference:

https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-europe/

Of course, this only makes sense if there is something to talk about. So please reply
with any suggestions for topics!

Also please let me know if you would expect to be at such a media summit in person.
If only a few people would be there, then there isn't much point to this.


I have two topics:

1) Discussion of the media subsystem development process: any bottlenecks, any ideas
   for improvements?

2) I can give a presentation on the work I've done in the CTA-861 standard (used by
   HDMI) and the edid-decode utility.

I'd like to make a decision on whether or not it is worthwhile to do this in a week
or two. If we wait too long it might be difficult to get a room for the summit.

Regards,

	Hans
