+Media Maintainers
+-----------------
+
+The media subsystem has three layers of media maintainers:
+
+- Media Maintainer:
+    Responsible for a group of drivers within the Media Subsystem. Typically
+    these are all drivers that have something in common, e.g. codec drivers
+    or drivers from the same vendor. Media Maintainers provide feedback if the
+    patches are not following the subsystem rules, or are not using the
+    media kernel or userspace APIs correctly, or have poor code quality. They
+    also keep patchwork up to date, decide when patches are ready for merging,
+    and create Pull Requests for the Media Subsystem Maintainers to merge.
+
+    A Media Maintainer is not just someone who is capable of creating code, but
+    someone who has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get
+    the most knowledgeable people to review code, contribute high-quality code,
+    and follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).
+
+- Media Core Maintainer:
+    Media Maintainers who are also responsible for one or more media core
+    frameworks.
+
+    Core framework changes are done via consensus between the relevant Media
+    Core Maintainers. Media Maintainers may include core framework changes in
+    their Pull Requests if they are signed off by the relevant Media Core
+    Maintainers.
+
+- Media Subsystem Maintainers:
+    Responsible for the subsystem as a whole, with access to the
+    entire subsystem. Responsible for merging Pull Requests from other
+    Media Maintainers.
+
+    Userspace API/ABI changes are done via consensus between Media Subsystem
+    Maintainers\ [2]_. Media (Core) Maintainers may include API/ABI changes in
+    their Pull Requests if they are signed off by the all Media Subsystem
+    Maintainers.
+
+All Media Maintainers shall explicitly agree with the Kernel development process
+as described at Documentation/process/index.rst and to the Kernel
+development rules inside the Kernel documentation, including its code of
+conduct.
+
+All Media Maintainers shall ensure that patchwork will reflect the current
+status, e.g. patches shall be delegated to the Media Maintainer who is
+handling them and the patch status shall be updated according to these rules:
+
+- ``Under Review``: Used if the patch requires a second opinion
+  or when it is part of a pull request;
+- ``Accepted``: Once a patch is merged in the multi-committer tree.
+- ``Superseded``: There is a newer version of the patch posted to the
+  mailing list.
+- ``Duplicated``: There was another patch doing the same thing from someone
+  else that was accepted.
+- ``Not Applicable``: Use for patch series that are not merged at media.git
+  tree (e.g. drm, dmabuf, upstream merge, etc.) but were cross-posted to the
+  linux-media mailing list.
+
+If the Media Maintainer decides not to accept a patch, then reply by email to
+the patch authors, explaining why it is not accepted, and patchwork shall be
+updated accordingly with either:
+
+- ``Changes Requested``: if a new revision was requested;
+- ``Rejected``: if the proposed change is not acceptable at all.
+
+.. Note::
+
+   Patchwork supports a couple of clients to help semi-automating
+   status updates via its REST interface:
+
+   https://patchwork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/clients/
+
+Media Maintainers are reachable via the #linux-media IRC channel at OFTC.
+
+.. [2] Everything that would break backward compatibility with existing
+       non-kernel code are API/ABI changes. This includes ioctl and sysfs
+       interfaces, v4l2 controls, and their behaviors.
+
+Becoming a Media Maintainer
+---------------------------
+
+The most important aspect of volunteering to be a Media Maintainer is that you
+have demonstrated the ability to give good code reviews. So we are looking for
+whether or not we think you will be good at doing that.
+
+As such, potential maintainers must earn enough credibility and trust from the
+Linux Media Community. To do that, developers shall be familiar with the open
+source model and have been active in the Linux Kernel community for some time,
+and, in particular, in the media subsystem.
+
+In addition to actually making the code changes, you are basically
+demonstrating your:
+
+- commitment to the project;
+- ability to collaborate with the team and communicate well;
+- understand of how upstream and the Linux Media Community work
+  (policies, processes for testing, code review, ...)
+- reasonable knowledge about:
+
+  - the Kernel development process:
+    Documentation/process/index.rst
+
+  - the Media development profile:
+    Documentation/driver-api/media/maintainer-entry-profile.rst
+
+- understanding of the projects' code base and coding style;
+- ability to provide feedback to the patch authors;
+- ability to judge when a patch might be ready for review and to submit;
+- ability to write good code (last but certainly not least).
+
+Developers that desire to become maintainers are encouraged to participate
+at the yearly Linux Media Summit, typically co-located with a Linux related
+conference. These summits will be announced at the linux-media mailing list.
+
+If you are doing such tasks and have become a valued developer, an
+existing Media Maintainer can nominate you to the Media Subsystem Maintainers.
+
+The ultimate responsibility for accepting a nominated maintainer is up to
+the subsystem's maintainers. The nominated maintainer must have earned a trust
+relationship with all Media Subsystem Maintainers, as, by becoming Media
+Maintainer, you will take over part of their maintenance tasks.
+
+Media Committers
+----------------
+
+Experienced and trusted Media (Core) Maintainers may be granted commit rights
+which allow them to directly push patches to the media development tree instead
+of posting a Pull Request for the Media Subsystem Maintainers. This helps
+offloading some of the work of the Media Subsystem Maintainers.
+
+Media development tree
+----------------------
+
+The main development tree used by the media subsystem is hosted at
+gitlab.freedesktop.org. LinuxTV.org hosts news about the subsystem, wiki pages
+and a patchwork instance where we track patches though their lifetime.
+
+The main tree used by media developers is at:
+
+https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/linux-media/media-committers.git
+
+Please note that this tree can be rebased, although only as a last resort.

+.. _Media development workflow:
+
+Media development workflow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+
+All changes for the media subsystem shall be sent first as e-mails to the
+media mailing list, following the process documented at
+Documentation/process/index.rst.
+
+It means that patches shall be submitted as plain text only via e-mail to
+linux-media@vger.kernel.org (aka: LMML). While subscription is not mandatory,
+you can find details about how to subscribe to it and to see its archives at:
+
+  https://subspace.kernel.org/vger.kernel.org.html
+
+Emails with HTML will be automatically rejected by the mail server.
+
+It could be wise to also copy the Media Maintainer(s). You should use
+``scripts/get_maintainers.pl`` to identify whom else needs to be copied.
+Please always copy driver's authors and maintainers.
+
+To minimize the chance of merge conflicts for your patch series, and make
+easier to backport patches to stable Kernels, we recommend that you use the
+following baseline for your patch series:
+
+1. Features for the next mainline release:
+
+   - baseline shall be the media-committers.git ``next`` branch;
+
+2. Bug fixes for the next mainline release:
+
+   - baseline shall be the media-committers.git ``next`` branch. If the
+     changes depend on a fix from the media-committers.git
+     ``fixes`` branch, then you can use that as baseline.
+
+3. Bug fixes for the current mainline release (-rcX):
+
+   - baseline shall be the latest mainline -rcX release or the
+     media-committers.git ``fixes`` branch if changes depend on a mainline
+     fix that is not yet merged;
+
+.. Note::
+
+   See https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html for an overview
+   about Kernel release types.
+
+Patches with fixes shall have:
+
+- a ``Fixes:`` tag pointing to the first commit that introduced the bug;
+- when applicable, a ``Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org``.
+
+Patches that were fixing bugs publicly reported by someone at the
+linux-media@vger.kernel.org mailing list shall have:
+
+- a ``Reported-by:`` tag immediately followed by a ``Closes:`` tag.
+
+Patches that change API shall update documentation accordingly at the
+same patch series.
+
+See Documentation/process/index.rst for more details about e-mail submission.
+
+Once a patch is submitted, it may follow either one of the following
+workflows:
+
+a. Media Maintainers' workflow: Media Maintainers post the PRs, which
+   are handled by the Media Subsystem Maintainers::
+
+     +-------+   +------------+   +------+   +-------+   +----------------------------+
+     |e-mail |-->|picked up by|-->|code  |-->|pull   |-->|Subsystem Maintainers merge |
+     |to LMML|   |patchwork   |   |review|   |request|   |in media-committers.git     |
+     +-------+   +------------+   +------+   +-------+   +----------------------------+
+
+   For this workflow, pull requests are generated by Media Maintainers.
+   If you are not a Media Maintainer, then please don't submit pull requests,
+   as they will not be processed.
+
+b. Media Committers' workflow: patches are handled by Media Maintainers with
+   commit rights::
+
+     +-------+   +------------+   +------+   +--------------------------+
+     |e-mail |-->|picked up by|-->|code  |-->|Media Committers merge in |
+     |to LMML|   |patchwork   |   |review|   |media-committers.git      |
+     +-------+   +------------+   +------+   +--------------------------+
+
+When patches are picked up by patchwork and when merged at media-committers,
+Media CI bots will check for errors and may provide e-mail feedback about
+patch problems. When this happens, the patch submitter must fix them or
+explain why the errors are false positives.
+
+Patches will only be moved to the next stage in these two workflows if they
+pass on Media CI or if there are false-positives in the Media CI reports.
+
+For both workflows, all patches shall be properly reviewed at
+linux-media@vger.kernel.org (LMML) before being merged in media-committers.git.
+Media patches will be reviewed in a timely manner by the maintainers and
+reviewers as listed in the MAINTAINERS file.
+
+Media Maintainers shall request reviews from other Media Maintainers and
+developers where applicable, i.e. because those developers have more
+knowledge about some areas that are changed by a patch.
+
+There shall be no open issues or unresolved or conflicting feedback
+from anyone. Clear them up first. Defer to the Media Subsystem
+Maintainers if needed.
