The v4l2_format struct is meant to describe the format of the data in memory,
not the rate at which the data has to be processed. It is the same for video:
v4l2_format describes the memory layout of the video data, not the framerate.
That is done through other ioctls (VIDIOC_S/G_PARM, a horrible ioctl, but
that's another story). So for audio the channel and format fields define how
the audio data is laid out in memory, but the rate has nothing to do with
that.

For this resampler you don't even need the rate at all, all you need is the
rate ratio, right? I.e. there is no difference when resampling from 10 kHz to 20 kHz
vs. 30 kHz to 60 kHz, the ratio is the same.

Or is that too simplistic and the hardware needs the actual rates as well?

Remember that I am a video guy, not an audio guy, so apologies if I ask stupid
questions!

Regardless, I don't believe the rate belongs to the audio format struct. It's
not how v4l2_format works. If the rate is needed, then that is probably best
done through controls, one for the source (output queue) and one for the
destination (capture queue).
