Laurent,

I think I figured out where the 90% calculation is located, but I can
only see it in the OMAP3530 TRM and not in the DM3730.

In the OMAP3530, Section 12.4.6.1.1 CCDC Features:

=E2=80=93 Data up to 8-bit at 130 MHz can be transferred to memory.
=E2=80=93 Data up to 10-bit at 75 MHz can be processed by the image pipelin=
e
or transferred to memory.
=E2=80=93 Data up to 12-bit at 75 MHz can be transferred to memory or
internally converted into 10-bit data to be processed by the image
pipeline.

If we assume the L3 is running at 166, then 166/2 =3D 83 and 83 * .9 =3D 74=
.7.

Does this seem like the right place?  If so,  then my impression is
that we should check for 10 or 12-bit mode before doing this math.  If
we're running at 8-bit, it seems to me like we can run at 130MHz for
the OMAP35, and potentially at 166MHz for the DM3730.

The Resizer has some of its own limitations, so when its invoked it
appears to have it's own limitations per section 6.4.7.2.1:

The horizontal resizer output rate must not exceed half the functional
clock; Moreover, the horizontal resizer output rate must not exceed
100M pixels/s. This limitation applies only for the on-the-fly
processing input source.

Either way, this is still 1/2 the clock rate of L3 and not 90% of that.

If you'll permit me, I'd like to add some code to if we're an
omap36xx.  Is so, I'd like to skip the 90% calculation for those
devices.  I have already been able to show that with it removed, I can
still capture paralell images at 96MHz.
