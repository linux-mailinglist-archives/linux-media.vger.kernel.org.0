Good news: the Linux Foundation found a room for us, for both the Tuesday
morning (8-12AM) and the whole of Wednesday (8AM-6PM).

The room is: Terreaux VIP Lounge - Level 0
It's boardroom seating for 15, screen & Projector, 3 power strips on the tables.

Many thanks to the LF for hosting this for us!

Regards,

	Hans
