You should NEVER disable CONFIG_ZONE_DMA32 for a system that has
memory > 4GB.  I've made this point repeatedly, but the ARM64 maintainers
insist on making it configurable instead of selecting it like most other
64-bit architetures that aren't guaranteed to always use a IOMMU.

We need to stop that.

dma_map_pages needs to map the pages as part of finding out that the
allocation actually works.  So skipping it can't really be done.

So why do you want to create your own mapping anyway?
