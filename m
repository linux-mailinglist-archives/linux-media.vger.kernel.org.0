Well, good point. I explained to much how it works, but now why.

In general I would describe the goal as: Providing a standard kernel 
infrastructure for user fences.

Yes, having an in kernel representation for vk user space fences is one 
of the goals.

And I was going back and forth if I should rather come up with a new 
structure for this or use the existing dma_fence with a flag as well.

I've decided to go down the later router because we have quite a lot of 
existing functionality which can be re-used. But if you have a good 
argument that it would be more defensive to come up with something 
completely new, I'm perfectly fine with that as well.

Yes, that's unfortunately one of the goals as well and yes I completely 
agree on the can of worms. But I think I've solved that.

What I do in the patch set is to enforce that the out fence is an user 
fence when the driver supports user in fences as well.

Since user fences doesn't have the memory management dependency drivers 
can actually allocate memory or call I2C functions which takes locks 
which have memory allocation dependencies.

Or do I miss some other reason why you can't fault or allocate memory in 
atomic_commit_tail? At least lockdep seems to be happy about that now.

Yes, unfortunately the uapi needs to stay compatible as well and yes 
that means we need to deploy this to all drivers involved.

We at least need to be able to provide a stack on new hardware with (for 
example) Ubuntu 18.04 without replacing all the userspace components.

What we can replace is the OpenGL stack and if necessary libdrm, but not 
(for example) the X server and most likely not the DDX in some cases.

The same applies with surfaceflinger and to some extend Wayland as well.

Christian.
