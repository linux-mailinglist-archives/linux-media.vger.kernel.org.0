That'd be a way to work around this, but the downside would be that the
user space would need to know not only which drivers to load, but also
which drivers _not_ to load. The user space could obtain the former from
the kernel but not the latter, it'd be system specific configuration.

Moving the responsibility of loading the driver to user space would also
not address figuring out whether the sensor is accessible through its
control bus: you have to power it on to do that. In fact, if you want to be
sure that the hardware is all right, you have to start streaming on the
device first and that is not a part of a typical driver initialisation
sequence. Just checking the sensor is accessible over I²C is not enough.

The proposed solution addresses the problem without user space changes.
