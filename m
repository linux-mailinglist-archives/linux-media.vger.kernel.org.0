Apologies for sleeping on that previous thread.

So what had been suggested over there was to use uclamp to boost the
frequency of the handling thread; however if you use threaded IRQs you
get RT threads, which already get the max frequency by default (at least
with schedutil).

Does that not work for you, and if so, why?
