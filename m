Dear Beloved,

Greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am Mrs.Grace Zinsou,
a widow to Late Chief.=C3=89mile D. Zinsou,I am 58 years old,and a born
again Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the
breast.From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and
is quite obvious that I may not live more than four months,because the
cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage.

My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all
his business and wealth because we have no child.My personal physician
told me that I may not live for more than four months and I am so
scared about this,So I now decided to divide part of this wealth,by
contributing to the development of evangelism and charity in Africa,
America, Europe and Asian. I am willing to donate the sum of
(USD$2.500,000.00 ) to your Orphanage and Ministry for the development
of evangelism,also as aids for the less privileged.

This fund is deposited in my late husband bank account,therefore, my
lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the
money in the name of your ministry. Do not reply me if you have the
intention of using this fund for personal purpose other than
enhancement of evangelism.Finally,I want you to be praying for me as
regards my entire life and my health.

May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet
fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.I await your urgent reply on
my private email address ( mrsgracezinsou@gmail.com )

Yours in Christ
Mrs.Grace Zinsou.
