I'm looking at merging this series, but I would like to have the output of
'v4l2-compliance -m /dev/mediaX' to verify that the MC links etc. is all
correct.

And one more question which may have been answered already in the past:

Changing to the MC will break existing applications, doesn't it? Or did I
miss something?

Regards,

	Hans
