I think this is a reasonable approach: the venus driver is quite old and it was
created when we were at more-or-less the same time also developing better codec
frameworks. So it is not quite up-to-date with all the latest requirements.

Starting with a clean slate for the iris driver and then add support for venus
platforms to the iris driver makes sense.

Just one serious concern: who will do the venus platform migration? Are there resources
available to do that work? Or is this just wishful thinking?
