It helps with the latency since the encoder can start its search and analyz=
es as
soon as frames are available, instead of until you have all N frames availa=
ble
(refer to the MIN_BUFFER_FOR controls used when lookahead is needed).

Omitting is not restricting. Vendors have to learn to be community members =
and
propose/add the tools and APIs they need to support their features. We cann=
ot
fix vendors in this regard, those who jumps over that fence are wining.
