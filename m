To give a bit more background: if it is decided to use the v4l API for this
(and I have no objection to this from my side since API/framework-wise it is a
good fit for this), then there are a number of things that need to be done to
get this into the media subsystem:

- documentation for the new uAPI
- add support for this to v4l2-ctl
- add v4l2-compliance tests for the new device
- highly desirable: have a virtual driver (similar to vim2m) that supports this:
  it could be as simple as just copy input to output. This helps regression
  testing.
- it might need media controller support as well. TBD.

None of this is particularly complex, but taken all together it is a fair
amount of work that also needs a lot of review time from our side.

I want to add one more option to the mix: drivers/media/core/v4l2-mem2mem.c is
the main m2m framework, but it relies heavily on the videobuf2 framework for
the capture and output queues.

The core vb2 implementation in drivers/media/common/videobuf2/videobuf2-core.c
is independent of V4L2 and can be used by other subsystems (in our case, it is
also used by the DVB API). It is a possibility to create an alsa version of
v4l2-mem2mem.c that uses the core vb2 code with an ALSA uAPI on top.

So in drivers/media/common/videobuf2/ you would have a videobuf2-alsa.c besides
the already existing videobuf2-v4l2.c and -dvb.c.

Perhaps parts of v4l2-mem2mem.c can be reused as well in that case, but I am
not sure if it is worth the effort. I suspect copying it to an alsa-mem2mem.c
and adapting it for alsa is easiest if you want to go that way.

Regards,
