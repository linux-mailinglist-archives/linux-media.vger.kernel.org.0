No, using a control for this is really wrong.

The reason why I want it as a separate memory type is that that is
what you use when you call VIDIOC_REQBUFS, and that ioctl is also
when things are locked down in a driver. As long as no buffers have
been allocated, you can still change formats, parameters, etc. But
once buffers are allocated, most of that can't be changed, since
changing e.g. the format would also change the buffer sizes.

It also locks down who owns the buffers by storing the file descriptor.
This prevents other processes from hijacking the I/O streaming, only
the owner can stream buffers.

So it is a natural point in the sequence for selecting secure
buffers.

If you request V4L2_MEMORY_DMABUF_SECURE for the output, then the
capture side must also use DMABUF_SECURE. Whether or not you can
use regular DMABUF for the output side and select DMABUF_SECURE
on the capture side is a driver decision. It can be useful to
support this for testing the secure capture using regular video
streams (something Nicolas discussed as well), but it depends on
the hardware whether you can use that technique.
