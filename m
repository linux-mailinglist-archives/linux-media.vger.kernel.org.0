Subject: [PATCH v2 05/22] media: docs: split meye.rst into admin and uAPI docs
Date:   Tue, 10 Mar 2020 14:42:56 +0100
Message-Id: <c16f22752f9c8b0e1cb9ddc26b4a46b3bc7b4ed6.1583847556.git.mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-media.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-media@vger.kernel.org

Instead of placing both info from admin PoV and uAPI at the
same place, split into two separate documents.

+Private API
+-----------
+
+The driver supports frame grabbing with the video4linux API,
+so all video4linux tools (like xawtv) should work with this driver.
+
+Besides the video4linux interface, the driver has a private interface
+for accessing the Motion Eye extended parameters (camera sharpness,
+agc, video framerate), the snapshot and the MJPEG capture facilities.
+
+This interface consists of several ioctls (prototypes and structures
+can be found in include/linux/meye.h):
+
+MEYEIOC_G_PARAMS and MEYEIOC_S_PARAMS
+	Get and set the extended parameters of the motion eye camera.
+	The user should always query the current parameters with
+	MEYEIOC_G_PARAMS, change what he likes and then issue the
+	MEYEIOC_S_PARAMS call (checking for -EINVAL). The extended
+	parameters are described by the meye_params structure.
+
+
+MEYEIOC_QBUF_CAPT
+	Queue a buffer for capture (the buffers must have been
+	obtained with a VIDIOCGMBUF call and mmap'ed by the
+	application). The argument to MEYEIOC_QBUF_CAPT is the
+	buffer number to queue (or -1 to end capture). The first
+	call to MEYEIOC_QBUF_CAPT starts the streaming capture.
+
+MEYEIOC_SYNC
+	Takes as an argument the buffer number you want to sync.
+	This ioctl blocks until the buffer is filled and ready
+	for the application to use. It returns the buffer size.
+
+MEYEIOC_STILLCAPT and MEYEIOC_STILLJCAPT
+	Takes a snapshot in an uncompressed or compressed jpeg format.
+	This ioctl blocks until the snapshot is done and returns (for
+	jpeg snapshot) the size of the image. The image data is
+	available from the first mmap'ed buffer.
+
+Look at the 'motioneye' application code for an actual example.
