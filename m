Yeah something like that. Michael Alwright has a patch at [0]
with improvments for the iss staging driver to get it working.
Have you seen that one?

I think it should be just something like this for
the target-module (on top of Michael's changes):

clocks = <&iss_clkctrl OMAP4_ISS_CLKCTRL 0>;
clock-names = "fck";

Then in the child node:

clocks = <&iss_clkctrl OMAP4_ISS_CLKCTRL 8>;
clock-names = "ctrlclk";

> And what about the dma nodes? Also keep in the target-module@52000000?

Those should be all in the child iss driver(s).

In general, it sounds like the iss is a private interconnect with
a control module for clocks etc, so doing it as multiple device
drivers probably makes sense.

Tony
