Hi Greg,

Thank you very much for your reply!

I'm so sorry for sending emails too frequently in the past two weeks.
I am willing to do something for the community. If you pay attention to my
previous submission records, you will find that I have assisted other
developers in modifying v4l2-compliance bugs. But I think currently I may
not have enough ability to comprehensively review others' submissions.
But I hope I can do something similar through learning later.
Sincere thanks to everyone who commented.

One of my colleagues is doing related development, but he also has other
projects at the same time, so he cannot devote all his efforts to this
development. And we expect to use libcamera, which may take some time.
